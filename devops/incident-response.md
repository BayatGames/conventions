## Introduction

The incident response and postmortem processes are designed to:

1. **Minimize Impact**: Reduce the duration and severity of incidents
2. **Promote Learning**: Learn from incidents to prevent recurrence
3. **Improve Systems**: Systematically strengthen our infrastructure and applications
4. **Build Trust**: Demonstrate reliability through transparent and effective incident handling

This document focuses on technical incidents affecting production systems, but similar principles can be applied to other types of incidents.

## Incident Severity Levels

Incidents are classified into severity levels to determine the appropriate response:

### Severity 1 (Critical)

- **Characteristics**:
  - Complete service outage affecting all users
  - Data loss or corruption
  - Security breach with significant impact

- **Response Requirements**:
  - Immediate response required (24/7)
  - All-hands involvement if needed
  - Executive notification
  - 15-minute maximum response time

- **Examples**:
  - Production database unavailable
  - Authentication system complete failure
  - Website completely down

### Severity 2 (High)

- **Characteristics**:
  - Partial service outage affecting many users
  - Major functionality degraded
  - Performance severely impacted

- **Response Requirements**:
  - Prompt response required (24/7)
  - Core team involvement
  - 30-minute maximum response time

- **Examples**:
  - Checkout process failing

- **Response Requirements**:
  - Can be scheduled for regular maintenance
  - 8-hour or next business day response

- **Examples**:
  - UI glitches
  - Minor reporting inaccuracies
  - Issues affecting internal-only features

## Incident Response Process

The incident response process follows these key phases:

### Detection

1. **Monitoring Alerts**: Automated system that detects and notifies of potential incidents
2. **User Reports**: Tracking and responding to user-reported issues
3. **Proactive Checks**: Regular health checks and monitoring to catch issues early

#### Key Actions

- Confirm the incident is real and gather initial data
- Make an initial severity assessment
- Start the incident response process for confirmed incidents

### Response

1. **Incident Declaration**:
   - Declare the incident formally
   - Determine severity level
   - Assign Incident Commander

2. **Team Assembly**:
   - Assemble appropriate response team based on severity
   - Establish communication channels

3. **Initial Assessment**:
   - Confirm scope and impact
   - Identify affected systems
   - Document initial findings

### Remediation

1. **Mitigation Strategy**:
   - Determine immediate steps to reduce impact
   - Consider temporary workarounds

2. **Implementation**:
   - Execute mitigation steps
   - Document all actions taken
   - Test effectiveness of mitigation

3. **Root Cause Investigation**:
   - Begin investigating underlying causes
   - Gather relevant logs and metrics
   - Document findings for later analysis

### Recovery

1. **Service Restoration**:
   - Implement full service restoration
   - Verify all systems are functioning properly
   - Monitor for any residual issues

2. **All-Clear Declaration**:
   - Formally declare the incident resolved
   - Notify all stakeholders
   - Schedule postmortem meeting

## Communication During Incidents

### Internal Communication

- **Primary Channel**: Dedicated incident response channel in Slack/Teams
- **Updates**: Regular status updates at predefined intervals
- **Handoffs**: Clear documentation of context when transferring ownership

### External Communication

- **Customer Communication**:
  - Public status page updates
  - Email/SMS notifications for critical incidents
  - Social media updates for widespread issues

- **Timing**:
  - Initial notification within 30 minutes of confirmed Sev1/Sev2 incidents
  - Updates at least every 60 minutes
  - Resolution notification and summary

- **Content Guidelines**:
  - Be honest and transparent
  - Avoid technical jargon
  - Focus on impact and mitigation
  - Provide workarounds when available
  - Commit only to what is certain

## Postmortem Process

Postmortems are conducted for all Severity 1 and 2 incidents, and optionally for lower severity incidents with learning potential.

### Scheduling

- Schedule within 2 business days of incident resolution
- Include all key participants from the incident
- Allocate sufficient time (usually 60-90 minutes)

### Postmortem Document Template

Each postmortem document should include:

1. **Incident Summary**
   - Date, time, and duration
   - Severity level
   - Systems affected
   - Customer impact
   - Response team members

2. **Timeline**
   - Detection time and method
   - Key events during the incident
   - Remediation steps and their effects
   - Resolution time

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
   - Primary cause(s)
   - Contributing factors
   - Trigger events

4. **What Went Well**
   - Effective detection mechanisms
   - Successful mitigation strategies
   - Good team collaboration
   - Effective tools and processes

5. **What Went Poorly**
   - Delayed detection or response
   - Ineffective mitigation attempts
   - Communication issues
   - Process or tooling gaps

6. **Corrective Actions**
   - Specific, actionable items
   - Assigned owners
   - Due dates
   - Success criteria

7. **Lessons Learned**
   - Key insights from the incident
   - Broader implications for systems or processes

### Root Cause Analysis

Root cause analysis should follow these principles:

1. **Blameless Culture**:
   - Focus on systems and processes, not individuals
   - Assume everyone acted with the best intentions
   - Seek understanding, not blame

2. **Five Whys Technique**:
   - Ask "why" repeatedly to dig deeper
   - Move beyond symptoms to underlying causes
   - Identify both technical and organizational factors

3. **Contributing Factors**:
   - Identify all factors that contributed to the incident
   - Consider technical, process, and human factors
   - Look for patterns across multiple incidents

### Corrective Actions

Effective corrective actions should be:

1. **Specific**: Clearly defined with concrete deliverables
2. **Measurable**: Success can be objectively verified
3. **Assigned**: Clear owner responsible for implementation
4. **Realistic**: Can be accomplished with available resources
5. **Time-bound**: Has a defined deadline

Categories of corrective actions:

- **Technical Improvements**: Code changes, architectural improvements
- **Process Improvements**: Documentation, runbooks, decision processes
- **Monitoring Improvements**: New alerts, dashboards, visibility
- **Training/Knowledge**: Sharing learnings, conducting trainings
- **Automation**: Reducing manual steps and human error
