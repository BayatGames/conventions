## Monitoring Principles

All monitoring and observability at Bayat should adhere to these core principles:

1. **Actionable**: Monitoring should provide actionable information
2. **Relevant**: Focus on what matters to the business and users
3. **Timely**: Detect and alert on issues promptly
4. **Transparent**: Make monitoring accessible to all stakeholders
5. **Comprehensive**: Cover all critical systems and components
6. **Automated**: Automate monitoring setup and maintenance
7. **Contextual**: Provide context to understand the significance of metrics
8. **Proportional**: Balance monitoring effort with system importance
9. **Historical**: Retain historical data for trend analysis
10. **Correlated**: Connect related information across monitoring systems

## Metrics Standards

### Core Metrics

Standardize on these core metrics for all systems:

| Category | Metrics | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| **Service Level** | Availability, Error Rate, Latency | Overall service health |
| **Resource** | CPU, Memory, Disk, Network | Resource utilization |
| **Application** | Request Count, Success Rate, Duration | Application performance |
| **Business** | Transactions, User Activity, Conversions | Business impact |
| **Dependencies** | External Service Health, Response Time | Dependency health |

### Metric Naming

Follow a consistent naming convention:

- Use lowercase with underscores as separators
- Use the format: `[namespace]_[metric_name]_[unit]`
- Group related metrics with a common prefix
- Be specific about what is being measured
- Include the unit of measurement where applicable

Examples:
```
http_requests_total
api_request_duration_seconds
database_connections_current
memory_usage_bytes
```

### Metric Types

Use appropriate metric types:

- **Counter**: Ever-increasing values (e.g., request count, errors)
- **Gauge**: Values that can go up and down (e.g., memory usage, queue depth)
- **Histogram**: Distribution of values (e.g., request duration)
- **Summary**: Similar to histogram but with calculated quantiles

### Metric Cardinality

Manage metric cardinality:

- Limit high-cardinality labels (e.g., user IDs, IP addresses)
- Focus on meaningful aggregations
- Consider sampling for high-volume metrics
- Document cardinality limits for each system

### Metric Collection Frequency

Standardize collection frequencies:

- **Critical Metrics**: 10-30 second intervals
- **Standard Metrics**: 1 minute intervals
- **Slow-changing Metrics**: 5+ minute intervals

Document the rationale for any deviations from these standards.

## Logging Standards

### Log Levels

Use standard log levels consistently:

- **ERROR**: System errors requiring immediate attention
- **WARN**: Potential issues that don't stop operation
- **INFO**: Normal operational information
- **DEBUG**: Detailed information for debugging
- **TRACE**: Very detailed debugging information

### Log Format

Structure logs in a consistent JSON format:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2023-05-08T12:34:56.789Z",
  "level": "INFO",
  "service": "payment-service",
  "instance": "payment-api-67890",
  "trace_id": "abc123def456",
  "message": "Payment processed successfully",
  "context": {
    "user_id": "user-123",
    "payment_id": "pmt-456",
    "amount": 99.95,
    "currency": "USD"
  }
}
```

Include these standard fields in all logs:

- **timestamp**: ISO 8601 format with timezone
- **level**: Log level
- **service**: Service or component name
- **instance**: Instance identifier
- **trace_id**: Distributed tracing ID
- **message**: Human-readable message

## Tracing Standards

### Trace Context Propagation

Implement distributed tracing across all services:

- Use W3C Trace Context or OpenTelemetry standards
- Propagate trace context in all service-to-service calls
- Ensure consistent trace ID format across all systems
- Include trace IDs in logs and metrics where relevant

### Span Naming

Use consistent span naming:

- Include the operation type and target
- Be specific but avoid high cardinality
- Use the format: `[operation].[target]`
- Document standard span names for common operations

Examples:
```
http.request
db.query
cache.get
payment.process
```

### Span Attributes

Include these standard attributes in spans:

- **service.name**: Name of the service
- **service.version**: Version of the service

- Apply the same review and approval process as application code
- Test monitoring changes before deployment
- Document monitoring code comprehensively

### Example Terraform Configuration

```hcl
# Define CloudWatch alarm for API Gateway
resource "aws_cloudwatch_metric_alarm" "api_5xx_error" {
  alarm_name          = "${var.service_name}-5xx-errors"
  comparison_operator = "GreaterThanThreshold"
  evaluation_periods  = 2
  metric_name         = "5XXError"
  namespace           = "AWS/ApiGateway"
  period              = 60
  statistic           = "Sum"
  threshold           = 5
  alarm_description   = "This alarm monitors for 5XX errors in the API"
  
  dimensions = {
    ApiName = var.api_name
    Stage   = var.environment
  }
  
  alarm_actions = [aws_sns_topic.alarm_topic.arn]
  ok_actions    = [aws_sns_topic.alarm_topic.arn]
  
  tags = local.common_tags
}
```

### Example Prometheus Configuration

```yaml
# prometheus.yml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'api_service'
    scrape_interval: 15s
    metrics_path: '/metrics'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['api-service:8080']
    relabel_configs:
      - source_labels: [__address__]
        target_label: instance
      - source_labels: [job]
        target_label: service

# alerts.yml
groups:
- name: api_alerts
  rules:
  - alert: HighErrorRate
    expr: rate(http_requests_total{status=~"5.."}[5m]) / rate(http_requests_total[5m]) > 0.05
    for: 2m
    labels:
      severity: critical
      team: api
    annotations:
      summary: "High HTTP error rate on {{ $labels.instance }}"
      description: "Error rate is {{ $value | humanizePercentage }} for the past 5 minutes"
      runbook: "https://runbooks.bayat.io/api/high-error-rate"
```

## Health Checks

### Health Check Types

Implement multiple health check types:

1. **Liveness**: Confirms the service is running
2. **Readiness**: Confirms the service can handle requests
3. **Dependency**: Confirms dependencies are available
4. **Functional**: Confirms business functions work correctly
5. **Synthetic**: Simulates user interactions

### Health Check Implementation

Standardize health check implementation:

- Expose health check endpoints for all services
- Use standard HTTP status codes (200 for healthy, non-200 for unhealthy)
- Include detailed health information in response body
- Set appropriate timeouts and intervals
- Document health check endpoints and expected responses

Example health check response:

```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "version": "1.2.3",
  "timestamp": "2023-05-08T12:34:56.789Z",
  "dependencies": {
    "database": {
      "status": "healthy",
      "responseTime": 15
    },
    "paymentGateway": {
      "status": "healthy",
      "responseTime": 120
    },
    "notificationService": {
      "status": "degraded",
      "responseTime": 450,
      "message": "High latency detected"
    }
  }
}
```

### Synthetic Monitoring

## SLIs, SLOs, and SLAs

### Service Level Indicators (SLIs)

Define standard SLIs for all services:

1. **Availability**: Percentage of successful requests
2. **Latency**: Request duration at various percentiles
3. **Error Rate**: Percentage of error responses
4. **Throughput**: Requests per second
5. **Saturation**: Resource utilization relative to capacity

### Service Level Objectives (SLOs)

Set clear SLOs for each SLI:

- Define measurement windows (e.g., 30 days)
- Set appropriate targets (e.g., 99.9% availability)
- Allocate error budgets
- Document SLO decision rationale
- Review and adjust SLOs regularly

Example SLO definition:

```
Service: Payment API
SLI: Availability
Definition: Percentage of requests that return a valid response (non-5xx)
Measurement: 30-day rolling window
Target: 99.95%
Error Budget: 0.05% (21.9 minutes per 30 days)
```
