# Embedded Systems and IoT Development Standards

This document outlines the standards and best practices for embedded systems and IoT development at Bayat.

## Hardware Platforms

### Microcontroller Selection
- **8-bit MCUs**: Use for simple, cost-constrained applications
- **32-bit MCUs**: Standard for most new designs (ARM Cortex-M series preferred)
- **Application Processors**: Use when OS or UI requirements exceed MCU capabilities
- **SoCs**: Platform selection criteria for complex IoT devices

### IoT Communication
- **Short-range**: Bluetooth LE, Wi-Fi, Zigbee, Thread based on requirements
- **Long-range**: LoRaWAN, NB-IoT, LTE-M for wide-area deployments
- **Wired**: Standards for RS-485, CAN, Ethernet implementations

## Software Development

### RTOS and Bare-metal
1. **RTOS Selection**:
   - FreeRTOS as standard RTOS when required

   - Resource sharing and synchronization patterns

### Language Standards
1. **C/C++ Guidelines**:
   - MISRA C compliance for safety-critical applications
   - C11/C++14 as standard versions
   - Restricted STL usage in C++ for embedded

2. **Other Languages**:
   - MicroPython guidelines for rapid prototyping
   - Rust for safety-critical, performance-sensitive applications
