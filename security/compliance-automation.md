# Compliance Automation Standards

This document outlines standards and best practices for automating compliance checks and security validations throughout the development lifecycle at Bayat. Following these standards ensures consistent, reliable, and efficient compliance management.

## Purpose

Compliance automation aims to:

1. **Reduce Manual Effort**: Minimize resource-intensive manual compliance checks
2. **Increase Consistency**: Ensure consistent application of compliance requirements
3. **Improve Velocity**: Enable rapid development while maintaining compliance
4. **Provide Evidence**: Automatically generate compliance evidence and artifacts
5. **Enhance Visibility**: Provide real-time compliance status visibility

## Compliance as Code

### Core Principles

Implement compliance as code using these principles:

1. **Declarative**: Define compliance requirements as code
2. **Versioned**: Version control compliance definitions
3. **Testable**: Validate compliance requirements with automated tests
4. **Reusable**: Create reusable compliance components
5. **Documented**: Self-document compliance requirements in code

### Implementation Approaches

Standardize implementation approaches:

1. **Policy as Code**: Define policies in machine-readable formats
2. **Compliance Pipelines**: Automate compliance checks in CI/CD
3. **Infrastructure as Code Validation**: Validate IaC for compliance
4. **Runtime Monitoring**: Continuously validate runtime compliance

## Automated Compliance Checks

### Continuous Compliance Pipelines

Implement continuous compliance pipelines:

1. **Pre-Commit Checks**: Validate basic compliance before code is committed
2. **Pull Request Validation**: Comprehensive compliance checks during review
3. **Build-Time Validation**: Validate during CI/CD build process
4. **Pre-Deployment Checks**: Validate before deployment to any environment
5. **Runtime Monitoring**: Continuously monitor compliance in production

### Standard Compliance Checks

Implement these standard automated checks:

1. **Security Controls**:
   - Secret scanning
   - SAST (Static Application Security Testing)
   - SCA (Software Composition Analysis)
   - Container scanning
   - Infrastructure code scanning

2. **Configuration Validation**:
   - Network configuration
   - Access controls
   - Encryption settings
   - Logging configuration

3. **Documentation Checks**:
   - Required documentation presence
   - Documentation accuracy
   - Documentation freshness

## Compliance Frameworks Integration

### Framework Mapping

Map compliance controls to common frameworks:

1. **Industry Standards**:
   - NIST Cybersecurity Framework
   - ISO 27001
   - SOC 2
   - HIPAA
   - PCI DSS
   - GDPR

2. **Custom Frameworks**:
   - Internal security standards
   - Client-specific requirements
   - Project-specific requirements

### Control Mapping Example

Example of control mapping structure:

```yaml
control:
  id: AC-01
  title: "Access Control Policy and Procedures"
  description: "The organization develops, documents, and disseminates..."
  frameworks:
    - framework: "NIST SP 800-53"
      control_id: "AC-1"
    - framework: "ISO 27001"
      control_id: "A.9.1.1"
    - framework: "SOC 2 (CC)"
      control_id: "CC6.1"
  implementation:
    - type: "Policy Document"
      location: "policies/access-control-policy.md"
    - type: "Automated Check"
      tool: "policy-scanner"
      rule_id: "AC-policy-validator"
      location: "compliance/rules/access-control.yml"
```

## Tools and Technologies

3. **Pipeline Integration**: Seamless integration into CI/CD pipelines
4. **Evidence Storage**: Automated storage of compliance evidence

## Implementation Examples

### CI/CD Integration Example

Example of CI/CD pipeline integration:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/compliance.yml
name: Compliance Checks

on:
  pull_request:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]

jobs:
  compliance:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      - name: Secret scanning
        uses: gitleaks/gitleaks-action@v2
        
      - name: SAST scan
        run: |
          semgrep ci --config=p/security-audit
          
      - name: Dependency scan
        uses: snyk/actions/node@master
        with:
          args: --severity-threshold=high
          
      - name: Infrastructure compliance
        run: |
          checkov -d terraform/ --framework=all
          
      - name: Policy validation
        run: |
          conftest test -p policies/ ./kubernetes/
          
      - name: Generate compliance report
        run: |
          compliance-reporter --output=compliance-report.json
          
      - name: Upload compliance artifacts
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: compliance-evidence
          path: compliance-report.json
```

### Policy as Code Example

Example of OPA policy:

```rego
package kubernetes.admission

deny[msg] {
  input.request.kind.kind == "Pod"
  container := input.request.object.spec.containers[_]
  not container.securityContext.runAsNonRoot
  
  msg := sprintf(
    "Container %s must set securityContext.runAsNonRoot = true",
    [container.name]
  )
}
```

## Evidence Collection and Reporting

### Evidence Requirements

Standards for compliance evidence:

1. **Completeness**: Capture all required evidence
2. **Immutability**: Ensure evidence cannot be altered
3. **Traceability**: Link evidence to specific requirements
4. **Consistency**: Standardize evidence format and metadata

### Automated Reporting

Requirements for automated reporting:

1. **Real-Time Dashboard**: Current compliance status
2. **Trend Analysis**: Compliance status over time
3. **Gap Analysis**: Identification of compliance gaps
4. **Evidence Repository**: Searchable repository of evidence

### Report Structure

Standard compliance report structure:

```json
{
  "report_id": "compliance-2023-06-15-123456",
  "timestamp": "2023-06-15T12:34:56Z",
  "project": "payment-service",
  "environment": "production",
  "overall_status": "compliant",
  "frameworks": [
    {
      "name": "PCI DSS",
      "version": "3.2.1",
      "status": "compliant",
      "controls": [
        {
          "id": "PCI-DSS-1.1.2",
          "description": "Firewall configuration standards",
          "status": "compliant",
          "evidence": [
            {
              "type": "scan_result",
              "tool": "firewall-validator",
              "location": "s3://compliance-evidence/firewall-scan-1234.json",
              "timestamp": "2023-06-15T10:00:00Z"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Compliance Monitoring

### Continuous Validation

Requirements for continuous validation:

1. **Runtime Checks**: Continuously validate production environment
2. **Drift Detection**: Identify deviations from compliant state
3. **Self-Healing**: Implement corrective actions where possible
4. **Alert on Violations**: Notify when compliance is broken

### Monitoring Implementation

Example configuration for continuous monitoring:

```yaml
# compliance-monitor.yml
monitors:
  - name: "S3 Bucket Policy Check"
    resource: "aws_s3_bucket"
    frequency: "1h"
    remediation: "auto"
    check:
      type: "AWS Config Rule"
      rule: "s3-bucket-public-write-prohibited"
    
  - name: "Kubernetes Pod Security"
    resource: "kubernetes_pod"
    frequency: "5m"
    remediation: "alert"
    check:
      type: "OPA Policy"
      policy: "pod-security-policy"
      
  - name: "Database Encryption"
    resource: "aws_rds_instance"
    frequency: "1d"
    remediation: "ticket"
    check:
      type: "Custom Script"
      script: "scripts/check-rds-encryption.sh"
```
