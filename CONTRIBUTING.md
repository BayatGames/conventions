## Code of Conduct

This project adheres to a Code of Conduct that all contributors are expected to follow. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

## How Can I Contribute?

- **Report inconsistencies**: Help us identify conflicting or unclear guidelines
- **Improve documentation**: Fix typos, clarify wording, add examples
- **Share implementation examples**: Provide real-world examples of conventions in action

## Proposing New Conventions

When proposing a new convention:

1. First, check existing documentation to ensure this isn't already covered
2. Create a new issue using the "New Convention Proposal" template
3. Clearly articulate:
   - The problem this convention solves
   - Why it's important
   - How it aligns with other conventions
   - Examples of implementation
4. Be prepared to discuss and iterate on your proposal

## Suggesting Changes to Existing Conventions

When suggesting changes to existing conventions:

1. Create a new issue using the "Convention Change" template
2. Reference the specific document/section you're addressing
3. Clearly explain the rationale for the change
4. Provide alternative approaches if applicable

## Pull Request Process

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch for your changes
3. Make your changes following our documentation standards
4. Run validation scripts locally:

   ```plaintext
   make validate
   make check-links
   ```

5. Submit a pull request with a clear description of the changes
6. Address any feedback from reviewers

## Documentation Standards
