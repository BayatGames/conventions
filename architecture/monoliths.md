## Overview

A monolithic architecture is a traditional unified model where the application is built as a single, indivisible unit. This document provides guidelines for effectively implementing monolithic applications at Bayat, recognizing that while microservices are often preferred for new large-scale projects, monolithic architectures remain valuable for many use cases.

## When to Use Monolithic Architecture

Consider a monolithic approach when:

- **Small to medium-sized applications** with limited complexity
- **Startups and MVPs** where speed to market is critical
- **Single-team applications** managed by a small development team
- **Limited expected growth** in features or scale
- **Constrained resources** for infrastructure management
- **Applications with significant cross-cutting concerns** requiring tight coupling
- **Batch processing systems** with sequential workflows
- **Simple CRUD applications** with straightforward business logic

## Architectural Principles

### Key Principles

- **Simplicity**: Keep the design as simple as possible
- **Cohesion**: Group related functionality together
- **Low Coupling**: Minimize dependencies between modules
- **Separation of Concerns**: Divide the application into distinct features with minimal overlap
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Avoid code duplication
- **SOLID Principles**: Apply all SOLID principles throughout the codebase
- **Defense in Depth**: Implement security at multiple layers
- **Fail Fast**: Detect and handle errors as early as possible

### Architecture Layers

Implement a clear layered architecture with well-defined responsibilities:

1. **Presentation Layer**: 
   - User interface components
   - API controllers
   - View models and DTOs

2. **Business Logic Layer**:
   - Services
   - Domain entities
   - Business rules
   - Workflow orchestration

3. **Data Access Layer**:
   - Repositories
   - Data mappers
   - ORM configuration
   - Query services

4. **Cross-Cutting Concerns**:
   - Logging
   - Authentication
   - Authorization
   - Caching
   - Exception handling

## Modular Design

### Module Organization

- **Vertical Slicing**: Organize by business capability/domain rather than technical layers
- **Bounded Context**: Define clear boundaries between different business domains
- **Interface-Based Design**: Define clear interfaces between modules
- **Dependency Management**: Use dependency injection to manage component dependencies
- **Service Locator Anti-Pattern**: Avoid service locator pattern in favor of DI

### Module Communication

- **Well-Defined APIs**: Modules should communicate through well-defined internal APIs
- **Event-Driven Communication**: Consider using internal events for cross-module communication
- **Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)**: Separate read and write operations when beneficial
- **Mediator Pattern**: Use mediator for cross-cutting operations

## Code Organization

### Project Structure

- **Feature-Based Organization**: Group code by feature/domain, not by type
- **Consistent Naming Conventions**: Follow language-specific conventions from our standards
- **Consistent File Organization**: Standardize file and directory structures
- **Solution Organization**: Organize Visual Studio solutions or equivalent by domain boundaries
- **Shared Code Management**: Carefully manage shared libraries and utilities

### Coding Standards

- **Follow Language-Specific Guidelines**: Adhere to our language-specific coding standards
- **Documentation**: Document public APIs, complex business logic, and design decisions
- **Code Style**: Use consistent code formatting and style guides
- **Static Analysis**: Implement static code analysis tools
- **Refactoring**: Regularly refactor to maintain code quality

## Database Design

### Schema Design

- **Normalized Design**: Follow normalization principles (typically 3NF) unless performance demands otherwise
- **Performance-Driven Denormalization**: Document and justify any denormalization
- **Consistent Naming**: Use consistent naming conventions for database objects
- **Versioning Strategy**: Implement database migration/versioning strategy
- **Indexes**: Design appropriate indexes based on query patterns

### Data Access

- **ORM Usage**: Prefer ORM tools for standard CRUD operations
- **Stored Procedures**: Use stored procedures for complex data operations when appropriate
- **Query Performance**: Optimize queries for performance
- **Connection Management**: Implement proper connection pooling and management
- **Transactions**: Use transactions appropriately to maintain data integrity

## Scalability

### Vertical Scaling

- **Resource Planning**: Plan for CPU, memory, and disk requirements
- **Load Testing**: Regularly load test to identify bottlenecks
- **Database Scaling**: Implement database scaling strategies (read replicas, sharding when necessary)
- **Caching Strategy**: Implement multi-level caching where appropriate

### Horizontal Scaling

Despite monolithic architecture, design for horizontal scalability where possible:

- **Statelessness**: Design application to be stateless where possible
- **Session Management**: Use external session stores
- **File Storage**: Use external file storage systems
- **Load Balancing**: Design to work behind load balancers
- **Database Connection Management**: Properly manage database connections for multiple instances

## Performance Optimization

### Application Performance

- **Profiling**: Regularly profile the application to identify bottlenecks
- **Caching Strategy**: Implement appropriate caching at multiple levels
  - Memory caching for frequently accessed data
  - Distributed caching for multi-instance deployments
  - Output caching for rendered content
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Use async/await patterns for I/O-bound operations
- **Resource Pooling**: Implement connection pooling and object pooling
- **Lazy Loading**: Load resources only when needed

### Front-end Performance

- **Minification**: Minify and bundle static resources
- **Compression**: Enable HTTP compression
- **CDN Integration**: Use CDNs for static content delivery
- **Optimized Images**: Optimize image size and format
- **Lazy Loading**: Implement lazy loading for UI components

## Testing

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Testing**: Comprehensive unit tests for all business logic
- **Integration Testing**: Test component interactions
- **UI/E2E Testing**: Test complete user flows
- **Load Testing**: Regular load testing to identify performance issues
- **Security Testing**: Regular security assessments

### Testing Best Practices

- **Test Pyramid**: Follow the test pyramid approach (more unit tests, fewer E2E tests)
- **Test Independence**: Tests should be independent and repeatable
- **Continuous Testing**: Integrate automated tests in CI/CD pipeline
- **Test Coverage**: Monitor and maintain high test coverage
- **Test Data Management**: Implement proper test data management

## Deployment

### Deployment Process

- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Implement automated build and deployment pipeline
- **Environment Parity**: Ensure development, staging, and production environments are similar
- **Blue-Green Deployment**: Consider blue-green deployment for zero-downtime updates
- **Rollback Strategy**: Implement easy rollback mechanisms
- **Configuration Management**: Externalize configuration from code

### Build Optimization

- **Build Process**: Optimize build process for speed
- **Artifact Management**: Properly version and store build artifacts
- **Dependency Management**: Carefully manage external dependencies

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Observability

- **Logging**: Implement structured logging across the application
- **Metrics Collection**: Collect performance and business metrics
- **Distributed Tracing**: Implement request tracing
- **Health Checks**: Implement health check endpoints
- **Dashboards**: Create monitoring dashboards for key metrics

### Operational Considerations

- **Backup Strategy**: Implement comprehensive backup procedures
- **Disaster Recovery**: Document and test disaster recovery procedures
- **Incident Response**: Establish clear incident response processes
- **Documentation**: Maintain up-to-date operational documentation
- **Runbooks**: Create operational runbooks for common tasks

## Migration Strategies

### Incremental Modernization

For existing monoliths that need modernization:

- **Strangler Pattern**: Gradually replace monolith components
- **Anti-Corruption Layer**: Use adapter layers to isolate legacy code
- **Parallel Development**: Run old and new systems in parallel during transition
- **Feature Flags**: Use feature flags to control migration
- **Data Migration Strategy**: Carefully plan and execute data migration

### Monolith to Microservices

When planning a transition to microservices:

- **Domain Analysis**: Identify bounded contexts for service boundaries
- **Dependency Mapping**: Map internal dependencies before decomposition
- **Incremental Extraction**: Extract services one at a time
- **Shared Database Transition**: Carefully manage transition away from shared database
- **API Gateway Introduction**: Consider API gateway for managing client transitions

## Anti-patterns to Avoid

- **Ball of Mud**: Unstructured code without clear architecture
- **God Classes**: Overly large classes with too many responsibilities
- **Spaghetti Code**: Tangled, hard-to-maintain code
- **Feature Creep**: Continuous addition of features without refactoring
- **Database as Integration Point**: Using the database as the primary integration mechanism
- **Hardcoded Dependencies**: Directly instantiating dependencies instead of injection
- **No Separation of Concerns**: Mixing presentation, business, and data access logic
- **Dual-Write Problem**: Writing to multiple data stores without transactional guarantees
- **Lack of Monitoring**: Insufficient observability into application behavior
