## Architectural Styles

### Supported Architectural Patterns

Select the most appropriate architectural style based on project requirements:

- **Microservices Architecture**
  - Preferred for large-scale applications with multiple teams
  - Follow our [Microservices Architecture Guidelines](microservices.md)
  - Consider service boundaries based on business domains

- **Monolithic Architecture**
  - Appropriate for smaller applications or initial MVPs
  - Follow our [Monolithic Architecture Guidelines](monoliths.md)
  - Design for potential future decomposition

- **Serverless Architecture**
  - Consider for event-driven workloads and variable scaling needs
  - Implement stateless functions with clear single responsibilities
  - Address cold start and state management challenges

- **Event-Driven Architecture**
  - Use for systems with asynchronous workflows

  - Define clear event schemas and versioning strategy

### Architecture Decision Records

- Document architectural decisions using Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
- Include context, decision, status, consequences, and alternatives considered
- Store ADRs with project documentation

## Design Principles

### Core Principles

- **Separation of Concerns**: Clearly separate different functional aspects
- **Single Responsibility**: Components should have one reason to change
- **Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)**: Avoid duplication through proper abstraction
- **Interface Segregation**: Prefer many specific interfaces over one general interface
- **Dependency Inversion**: Depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations
- **Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)**: Separate read and write operations when beneficial
- **Domain-Driven Design**: Align system architecture with business domains

### Quality Attributes

Prioritize these quality attributes in backend systems:

- **Reliability**: Systems should function correctly under normal and adverse conditions
- **Scalability**: Ability to handle growth in load and data
- **Security**: Protection against unauthorized access and attacks
- **Maintainability**: Ease of modification and extension
- **Performance**: Responsiveness and efficiency
- **Observability**: Ability to understand internal state from external outputs
- **Testability**: Ease of testing at different levels
