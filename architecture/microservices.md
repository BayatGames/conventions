## Microservices Principles

All microservices-based applications at Bayat should adhere to the following core principles:

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each service should focus on a specific business capability
2. **Autonomy**: Services should be developed, deployed, and scaled independently
3. **Resilience**: Services should be designed to gracefully handle failures
4. **Decentralization**: Avoid shared databases and centralized governance
5. **Observable**: Services must expose metrics, logs, and traces
6. **Evolutionary Design**: Design for change and continuous refactoring
7. **Domain-Driven**: Align services with business domains
8. **Automation**: Maximize automation for development, testing, and operations

## Service Design

### Service Boundaries

Define service boundaries based on:

- Business capabilities and domains
- Team structure and ownership
- Data cohesion and access patterns
- Change frequency and scalability requirements

A well-designed service should:
- Encapsulate a clear business capability
- Own its data and expose it only through well-defined interfaces
- Be independently deployable and testable
- Have a focused and maintainable codebase (< 10,000 LOC guideline)

### Service Size Guidelines

Consider the following factors when determining service size:

- **Too Large**: Multiple domains, overlapping concerns, complex interfaces, diverse data needs
- **Too Small**: Tight coupling to other services, excessive inter-service communication, limited functionality
- **Just Right**: Clear responsibility, manageable codebase, reasonable interface, team ownership

### Service Types

Standardize on the following service patterns:

- **API Services**: Expose functionality to clients and other services
- **Processing Services**: Handle background and asynchronous workloads
- **Integration Services**: Adapt and translate between external systems
- **Aggregation Services**: Combine multiple service responses for clients
- **Infrastructure Services**: Provide common platform capabilities

## Communication Patterns

### Synchronous Communication

For real-time interactions:

- Use REST for simple CRUD operations and queries
- Use GraphQL for complex data queries and aggregations
- Use gRPC for high-performance internal service communication
- Implement proper timeouts, retries, and circuit breakers
- Document all synchronous APIs comprehensively

### Asynchronous Communication

For event-driven and decoupled operations:

- Use message queues (RabbitMQ, Amazon SQS) for task distribution
- Use event streaming (Kafka, Kinesis) for event sourcing and analysis
- Implement idempotent receivers to handle duplicate events
- Design for at-least-once delivery semantics
- Maintain event schemas and versioning

### Choosing the Right Pattern

| Scenario | Recommended Pattern |
|----------|---------------------|
| User-initiated actions | Synchronous REST/GraphQL |
| Data querying | Synchronous REST/GraphQL |
| Long-running operations | Asynchronous with callbacks |
| System events | Event streaming |
| Cross-service workflows | Orchestration service or choreography |
| High-volume data processing | Event streaming |

### Communication Standards

- All service-to-service communication must be encrypted (TLS)
- Authentication required for all service calls
- Use standard headers for tracing, correlation IDs, and tenant information
- Implement graceful degradation when dependent services are unavailable

## Data Management

### Data Ownership

- Each service owns and manages its data
- No direct database access from outside the service
- Data is only exposed through service APIs
- Consider CQRS for complex read/write patterns

### Database Per Service

Implement database-per-service pattern:

- Each service has its own logical database
- Services should not share database instances in production
- Choose the appropriate database type for each service (relational, NoSQL, time-series, etc.)
- Implement proper data backup and recovery procedures

### Data Consistency

For maintaining consistency across services:

- Prefer eventual consistency where possible
- Use the Saga pattern for distributed transactions
- Implement compensating transactions for failure recovery
- Consider event sourcing for complex state tracking
- Document consistency guarantees for each service

### Data Duplication

When duplicating data across services:

- Clearly document the source of truth
- Implement data synchronization mechanisms
- Use event-based updates to propagate changes
- Track synchronization health and alert on inconsistencies

## API Design

### API Standards

All service APIs must follow these standards:

- Use HTTP status codes correctly
- Implement consistent error response formats
- Use hypermedia links when appropriate (HATEOAS)
- Follow RESTful resource naming conventions
- Version all APIs explicitly

### API Documentation

Document all APIs using:

- OpenAPI (Swagger) for REST APIs
- GraphQL Schema with descriptions for GraphQL APIs
- Protocol Buffers with comments for gRPC APIs
- Include example requests and responses
- Document error conditions and handling

### API Versioning

Implement proper API versioning:

- Use semantic versioning for API changes
- Include version in URL path (`/v1/resources`)
- Support at least one previous version during transition periods
- Document deprecation timelines
- Provide migration guides for breaking changes

### API Gateways

Use API gateways for:

- Request routing
- Authentication and authorization
- Rate limiting and throttling
- Response caching
- Analytics and monitoring
- Cross-cutting concerns (CORS, compression)

## Service Discovery

### Discovery Mechanisms

Implement service discovery using:

- DNS-based discovery for simplicity
- Service registry (Consul, etcd) for dynamic environments
- Load balancers for stable endpoints
- Kubernetes service discovery when applicable

### Client-Side Discovery

For client-side discovery:

- Use service registries for real-time service information
- Implement health-check-aware client libraries
- Consider client-side load balancing for high-volume calls
- Cache service information with appropriate TTLs

### Server-Side Discovery

For server-side discovery:

- Use load balancers or API gateways
- Configure proper health checks
- Implement proper failover mechanisms
- Document discovery endpoints

## Deployment and Scaling

### Containerization

Package services as containers:

- Use Docker for containerization
- Create minimal container images
- Avoid storing sensitive data in containers
- Scan container images for vulnerabilities
- Follow container security best practices

### Container Orchestration

Use Kubernetes for container orchestration:

- Deploy each service as a separate Kubernetes deployment
- Use namespaces for environment isolation
- Implement proper resource requests and limits
- Use horizontal pod autoscaling based on metrics
- Configure appropriate liveness and readiness probes

### Scaling Policies

Define scaling policies for each service:

- Identify scaling metrics (CPU, memory, requests per second, queue depth)
- Set appropriate minimum and maximum instance counts
- Configure scaling thresholds based on performance testing
- Document scaling behaviors and limitations
- Test scaling under load

Example Kubernetes HPA configuration:

```yaml
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: order-service
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: order-service
  minReplicas: 3
  maxReplicas: 10
  metrics:
  - type: Resource
    resource:
      name: cpu
      target:
        type: Utilization
        averageUtilization: 70
  - type: Pods
    pods:
      metric:
        name: requests_per_second
      target:
        type: AverageValue
        averageValue: 500
```

## Monitoring and Observability

### Metrics

Each service must expose the following metrics:

- Request count, latency, and error rates
- Resource utilization (CPU, memory, disk, network)
- Business-specific metrics
- Dependencies health and performance
- Queue depths and processing rates

Use Prometheus or similar systems for metrics collection and alerting.

### Logging

Implement standardized logging:

- Use structured logging formats (JSON)
- Include correlation IDs in all logs
- Log at appropriate levels (ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG)
- Centralize logs with Elasticsearch, Splunk, or similar
- Implement log retention policies

Log entry example:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2023-03-12T15:22:31.123Z",
  "level": "INFO",
  "service": "order-service",
  "instance": "order-service-7d9f6b5b9c-2jkvn",
  "traceId": "4c0f8c2b-cb4e-11ed-afa1-0242ac120002",
  "userId": "user-123",
  "message": "Order created successfully",
  "orderId": "order-456",
  "orderValue": 129.99
}
```

### Distributed Tracing

Implement distributed tracing:

- Use OpenTelemetry for instrumentation
- Propagate trace context across service boundaries
- Sample traces based on environment and traffic volume
- Collect traces in Jaeger, Zipkin, or similar systems
- Analyze traces for performance optimization

### Health Checks

Implement comprehensive health checks:

- **Liveness**: Basic check if service is running
- **Readiness**: Check if service can handle requests
- **Dependency**: Check status of critical dependencies
- **Business logic**: Verify critical functionalities
- **Deep health**: End-to-end verification of key flows

Example health check implementation:

```typescript
@Controller('health')
export class HealthController {
  constructor(
    private db: DatabaseService,
    private messageQueue: MessageQueueService,
  ) {}

  @Get('liveness')
  async liveness() {
    return { status: 'UP' };
  }

  @Get('readiness')
  async readiness() {
    const dbStatus = await this.db.ping();
    const mqStatus = await this.messageQueue.ping();
    
    return {
      status: dbStatus.healthy && mqStatus.healthy ? 'UP' : 'DOWN',
      details: {
        database: dbStatus,
        messageQueue: mqStatus,
      }
    };
  }
}
```

## Security

### Authentication and Authorization

Implement robust authentication and authorization:

- Use OAuth 2.0 or OpenID Connect for authentication
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC)
- Use short-lived tokens and proper token validation
- Implement proper API key management for service-to-service communication
- Audit all authentication and authorization decisions

### Network Security

Secure the network layer:

- Encrypt all service-to-service communication (mutual TLS)
- Implement network policies to restrict traffic between services
- Use API gateways for external traffic
- Scan for network vulnerabilities regularly
- Document network topology and security controls

### Secure Coding

Follow secure coding practices:

- Validate all inputs
- Protect against common vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10)
- Use secure dependencies and keep them updated
- Perform regular security scans of codebase and containers

### Secrets Management

Manage secrets securely:

- Use dedicated secrets management solutions (HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)
- Never store secrets in code or configuration files
- Rotate secrets regularly
- Audit secret access
- Implement least privilege for secret access

## Testing

## DevOps Practices

### CI/CD Pipeline

Implement comprehensive CI/CD:

- Automated builds for every commit
- Unit and integration tests for every build
- Vulnerability scanning
- Static code analysis
- Automated deployments to development environments
- Controlled promotions to higher environments

Example CI/CD Pipeline:

```yaml
# GitLab CI/CD pipeline example
stages:
  - build
  - test
  - scan
  - deploy-dev
  - integration-test
  - deploy-staging
  - performance-test
  - deploy-prod

build:
  stage: build
  script:
    - docker build -t ${SERVICE_NAME}:${CI_COMMIT_SHA} .
    - docker push ${SERVICE_NAME}:${CI_COMMIT_SHA}

unit-test:
  stage: test
  script:
    - npm run test:unit

integration-test:
  stage: test
  script:
    - npm run test:integration

security-scan:
  stage: scan
  script:
    - trivy image ${SERVICE_NAME}:${CI_COMMIT_SHA}
    - sonarqube-scanner

deploy-dev:
  stage: deploy-dev
  script:
    - helm upgrade --install ${SERVICE_NAME} ./charts/${SERVICE_NAME} --set image.tag=${CI_COMMIT_SHA} -n development
  environment:
    name: development

# Additional stages for higher environments
```

### Infrastructure as Code

Manage infrastructure through code:

- Use Terraform, CloudFormation, or similar for infrastructure provisioning
- Use Helm charts for Kubernetes deployments
- Version control all infrastructure code
- Review infrastructure changes
- Test infrastructure changes in non-production environments

### Feature Flags

Implement feature flags for controlled releases:

- Use centralized feature flag management
- Deploy code with features disabled by default
- Enable features gradually
- Monitor feature impact
- Support easy rollback through feature disablement

## Service Templates

### Starter Templates

Provide standardized service templates for common patterns:

- REST API service
- Event processor service
- GraphQL service
- Background worker service
- Integration service

Each template should include:

- Basic service structure
- Standardized logging, metrics, and tracing
- Health checks
- Documentation templates
- CI/CD configuration
- Deployment manifests

Example Service Structure:

```

```

### Shared Libraries

Develop and maintain shared libraries for common functionalities:

- Authentication and authorization
- Logging and observability
- Resilience patterns (circuit breakers, retries)
- Common data models
- API clients

## Governance

### Service Catalog

Maintain a central service catalog:

- Document all services and their responsibilities
- Track service owners and dependencies a  
- Monitor service health and SLAs
- Review service metrics and quality

Example Service Registry Entry:

```yaml
name: order-service
description: Manages order creation and processing
team: commerce
owner: commerce-team@bayat.io
repository: https://git.bayat.io/commerce/order-service
api-documentation: https://docs.bayat.io/apis/order-service
dependencies:
  - user-service
  - product-service
  - payment-service
sla:
  availability: 99.95%
  latency_p95: 300ms
technologies:
  language: Node.js
  framework: NestJS
  database: MongoDB
  messaging: RabbitMQ
```

### Architecture Review

Establish architecture review process:

- Review new service proposals
- Evaluate changes to service boundaries
- Assess technology choices
- Verify compliance with standards
- Provide design feedback and guidance

### Standards Evolution

Continuously improve standards:

- Gather feedback from development teams
- Review and update standards quarterly
- Communicate changes clearly
- Provide migration paths for existing services
- Run architecture town halls for knowledge sharing

## Migration Strategies

### Monolith to Microservices

Guidelines for decomposing monoliths:

1. **Start with domains**: Identify bounded contexts in the monolith
2. **Strangler pattern**: Gradually replace monolith functionality
3. **Data separation**: Extract service-specific data incrementally
4. **API facade**: Create API layer over the monolith
5. **Prioritize value**: Begin with high-value or problematic areas

### Implementation Approach

Recommended implementation sequence:

1. Create the new service with its own database
2. Implement data synchronization from monolith to service
3. Redirect reads to the new service
4. Redirect writes to the new service
5. Migrate historical data
6. Remove functionality from the monolith

### Common Challenges

Address common migration challenges:

- **Shared data**: Use data replication or views initially
- **Transactions**: Implement sagas for distributed transactions
- **Authentication**: Create unified authentication service
- **Deployment**: Use blue/green deployments for seamless transition
- **Testing**: Create comprehensive test suite before migration
