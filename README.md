## Using These Conventions

All team members are expected to follow these conventions for new projects and when contributing to existing ones. For legacy projects that don't follow these standards, a migration plan should be created when significant changes are planned.

### Validation and Consistency

To ensure documentation consistency and completeness:

1. Use the validation script to check if all documentation files are properly referenced:

   ```bash
   make validate
   ```

2. Check for broken links in documentation:

   ```bash
   make check-links
   ```

3. Run all validation checks at once:

   ```bash
   make check-all
   ```

### Document Templates

When creating new documentation files:

1. Use the document version header template from [Document Version Header](templates/document-version-header.md)
2. Follow the section organization guide in [Section Organization](templates/section-organization.md)
3. Keep documentation up to date, with correct version information

## Contributing to Conventions

These conventions are not static and should evolve with industry trends and team experiences. To propose changes:

1. Create a new branch from `main` following our [Git Flow](docs/git/flow.md)
2. Make your proposed changes
3. Submit a pull request with detailed explanation of the rationale for the change
4. After review and approval, changes will be merged and communicated to all teams

## Enforcement

These conventions are enforced through:

1. Code review processes
2. Automated linting and formatting tools
3. CI/CD pipeline checks
4. Regular training and workshops

Exceptions to these conventions may be allowed in specific circumstances but must be documented and approved by team leads.
