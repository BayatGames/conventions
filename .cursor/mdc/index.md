# Bayat Development Conventions - Multi-Document Context

This directory contains quick reference guides for development conventions used across Bayat projects. These files are designed to be consumed by Cursor IDE to provide contextual information while coding.

## Available Convention Guides

- [Git Conventions](git_conventions.md) - Branch structure, commit message standards
- [TypeScript Conventions](typescript_conventions.md) - Naming, type definitions, React-specific guidelines
- [Code Quality Standards](code_quality.md) - Testing, code review, documentation requirements
- [Architecture Standards](architecture_standards.md) - API design, frontend/backend architecture, microservices
- [Project Setup](project_setup.md) - Project structure, environment, deployment standards

## Using MDC Files with Cursor

The MDC files are automatically recognized by Cursor IDE and provide context-aware suggestions during development. The rules in `.cursorrules` define when specific context should be applied.
