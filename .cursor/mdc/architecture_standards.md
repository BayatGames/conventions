# Architecture Standards

## API Design

- RESTful API principles
- Use HTTP status codes correctly
- Consistent error response format
- API versioning in URL path (/api/v1/...)
- Resource-based URL structure
- Support filtering, pagination, and sorting
- Authentication via JWT or OAuth2

## Frontend Architecture

- Component-based design
- State management with context or Redux

## Backend Architecture

- Clean architecture principles
- Dependency injection
- Repository pattern for data access
- Service layer for business logic
- Middleware for cross-cutting concerns
- Stateless design where possible
- Asynchronous processing for long-running tasks

## Microservices Guidelines

- Single responsibility principle
- Independent deployment
- Service discovery mechanism
- API gateway for client access
- Event-driven communication
- Distributed logging and tracing
- Circuit breakers for resilience

## Database Standards

- Schema version control
- Use migrations for schema changes
