# Technical Writing Guide

## Introduction

Technical writing is a specialized form of writing focused on communicating complex technical information clearly and effectively. This guide provides standards and best practices for creating high-quality technical content across all Bayat projects.

## Core Principles

### Clarity

- Use simple, direct language
- Define technical terms when first used
- Break complex ideas into smaller, manageable parts
- Focus on one main idea per paragraph

### Accuracy

- Verify all technical information
- Include version numbers where relevant
- Cite sources for external information
- Maintain consistency in terminology

### Audience Awareness

- Identify your audience before writing
- Adjust technical depth based on audience expertise
- Consider cultural and language differences
- Address the audience's goals and needs

### Structure

- Organize content with a clear hierarchy
- Use descriptive headings and subheadings
- Present information in a logical sequence
- Include navigation aids for longer documents

## Voice and Tone

### Standard Voice

- Professional but conversational
- Active voice (preferred over passive)
- Second person ("you") for instructions
- Confident but not authoritative

### Contextual Tone Adjustments

- **Tutorials**: Encouraging and step-by-step
- **Reference materials**: Precise and neutral
- **Troubleshooting guides**: Empathetic and solution-oriented
- **API documentation**: Concise and technical

## Document Types

### Tutorials

- Start with clear prerequisites
- Include a working example
- Break into discrete, achievable steps
- Explain the why behind actions
- End with next steps or further learning

### How-to Guides

- Focus on specific tasks
- Use numbered steps for sequential procedures
- Include examples for complex steps
- Add troubleshooting tips for common issues

### Conceptual Documentation

- Explain ideas and abstract concepts
- Use analogies to simplify complex topics
- Include diagrams and visual aids
- Connect concepts to practical applications

### Reference Documentation

- Organize for quick information retrieval
- Use consistent formatting for similar items
- Include all relevant parameters and options
- Link to related concepts and examples

### Release Notes

- Categorize changes (new features, improvements, bug fixes)
- Highlight breaking changes prominently
- Include migration instructions when needed
- Use consistent versioning references

## Writing Style Guidelines

### Sentences and Paragraphs

- Use short to medium-length sentences (15-25 words)
- Limit paragraphs to 3-5 sentences
- Use transitional phrases between paragraphs
- Vary sentence structure to maintain interest

### Word Choice

- Use consistent terminology throughout
- Avoid jargon unless necessary for the audience
- Replace idioms with direct language
- Choose specific over general terms

### Lists

- Use bulleted lists for unordered items
- Use numbered lists for sequential steps
- Keep list items parallel in structure
- Aim for 3-7 items per list

### Tables

- Use tables to organize complex information
- Include clear column headers
- Align numerical data appropriately
- Provide a descriptive caption

## Formatting Standards

### Typography

- Use sentence case for headings
- Apply consistent heading hierarchy
- Use bold for emphasis (sparingly)
- Use italics for defined terms and UI elements

### Code Formatting

- Use monospace font for code
- Include syntax highlighting where possible
- Clearly distinguish inline code from surrounding text
- Provide complete, runnable examples

### Links

- Use descriptive link text (not "click here")
- Indicate external links consistently
- Verify links regularly
- Group related links at the end of sections

### Images and Diagrams

- Use high-quality, accessible images
- Include descriptive alt text
- Add captions explaining the image purpose
- Maintain consistent style across diagrams

## Accessibility

### Text Accessibility

- Use sufficient color contrast
- Don't rely solely on color to convey information
- Use descriptive headings for screen readers
- Avoid directional references ("below" or "right")

### Media Accessibility

- Provide transcripts for audio content
- Add captions to video content
- Create alt text for all meaningful images
- Make diagrams screenreader-compatible

### Document Structure

- Use proper heading hierarchy (H1, H2, H3)
- Create accessible tables with headers
- Use semantic HTML when publishing online
- Test documents with accessibility tools

## Review Process

### Self-Review

- Wait at least one hour before self-reviewing
- Read content aloud to catch awkward phrasing
- Check for consistency in terminology and style
- Verify all examples work as described

### Peer Review

- Request technical review from subject matter experts
- Seek editorial review for clarity and style
- Include accessibility review in the process
- Document and track feedback systematically

### User Testing

- Test documentation with target audience members
- Observe users following documentation
- Collect structured feedback
- Iterate based on user experience

## Tools and Templates

### Recommended Tools

- Markdown for standard documentation
- Asciidoc for complex technical documentation
- Mermaid or PlantUML for diagrams
- Grammarly or similar for grammar checking

### Templates

- Project README template
- API documentation template
- Tutorial template
- Troubleshooting guide template

## Versioning and Maintenance

### Version Control

- Store documentation in the same repository as code
- Version documentation alongside software releases
- Tag documentation changes in commits
- Track major documentation revisions

### Maintenance Schedule

- Review documentation at least quarterly
- Update with each major software release
- Archive obsolete documentation
- Establish ownership for ongoing maintenance

## Localization Considerations

### Writing for Translation

- Use simple sentence structures
- Avoid culturally specific references
- Provide context for translators
- Allow for text expansion in layouts

### Translation Management

- Maintain glossaries for consistent terminology
- Provide style guides for translators
- Include translation memory in the workflow
- Test translated documentation with target audiences
