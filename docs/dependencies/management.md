# Dependency Management

This document outlines the standards and best practices for managing dependencies across all Bayat projects.

## General Principles

- Always specify exact versions of dependencies to ensure reproducible builds
- Regularly audit and update dependencies for security vulnerabilities
- Document the purpose of each dependency in the project documentation
- Minimize the number of dependencies to reduce complexity and potential security issues
- Consider the license of each dependency before including it in a project

## Version Specification

### JavaScript/TypeScript

- Use npm or yarn with lockfiles (package-lock.json or yarn.lock)
- Specify exact versions in package.json (`"package": "1.2.3"` instead of `"package": "^1.2.3"`)
- Group dependencies logically (dev dependencies, runtime dependencies, etc.)

### Python

- Use pip with requirements.txt or Poetry
- Pin specific versions in requirements.txt (`package==1.2.3`)
- Include hashes for added security

### C#/.NET

- Use NuGet packages with specified versions in .csproj files
- Consider using PackageReference instead of packages.config
- Use a centralized Directory.Packages.props file for version management in larger solutions

## Third-Party Libraries

### Evaluation Criteria

- Activity level of the project (recent commits, issues, PRs)
- Size and engagement of the community
- Documentation quality
- Test coverage
- License compatibility
- Security history
- Performance impact
- Maintenance burden

### Approval Process

1. Identify need for external dependency
2. Research available options
3. Evaluate against criteria
4. Document justification
5. Get approval from team lead
6. Include in project with proper versioning

## Monorepo Dependencies

For monorepo projects:

- Use workspace features of package managers where available
- Maintain consistent versions across all packages
- Document internal dependencies clearly

## Dependency Updates

### Schedule

- Security updates: Immediate
- Major versions: Quarterly review
- Minor versions: Monthly review
- Patch versions: Bi-weekly review

### Process

1. Review release notes for breaking changes
2. Update in development environment
3. Run automated tests
4. Perform manual testing if needed
5. Document changes in project changelog
6. Create a dedicated PR for the update

## Vulnerability Management

- Enable automated security scanning in CI/CD pipeline
- Subscribe to security advisories for critical dependencies
- Document the remediation process for vulnerable dependencies
- Maintain a dependency inventory for each project

## Custom and Internal Dependencies

- Prefer internal packages for shared functionality
- Document and version internal packages following the same standards
- Use private registries for internal packages

## Auditing Tools

- Use npm audit, Poetry audit, or equivalent tools regularly
- Integrate auditing into CI/CD pipeline
- Generate dependency reports for compliance and security reviews
