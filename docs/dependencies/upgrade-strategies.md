## Introduction

Effective dependency management is crucial for maintaining secure, stable, and maintainable software projects. This document provides guidelines for selecting, managing, upgrading, and auditing dependencies in a consistent and efficient manner.

### Why Dependency Management Matters

- **Security**: Outdated dependencies often contain known vulnerabilities
- **Performance**: Newer versions often include performance improvements
- **Features**: Stay current with latest features and capabilities
- **Compatibility**: Ensure continued compatibility with other components
- **Technical Debt**: Prevent accumulation of debt from outdated dependencies
- **Support**: Vendors eventually drop support for older versions

## Dependency Management Principles

### Core Principles

1. **Minimalism**: Use as few dependencies as necessary
2. **Intentionality**: Every dependency should serve a clear purpose
3. **Sustainability**: Prefer actively maintained dependencies
4. **Stability**: Balance staying current with maintaining stability
5. **Visibility**: Maintain a clear inventory of all dependencies
6. **Consistency**: Use consistent versions across projects when possible
7. **Security-First**: Prioritize security updates over feature updates

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

1. **Dependency Hell**: Accumulating too many interdependent packages
2. **Version Freezing**: Never updating dependencies
3. **Update Anxiety**: Constant major version updates without testing
4. **Transitive Dependency Blindness**: Not knowing what your dependencies depend on
5. **Overly Optimistic Versioning**: Using `*` or `latest` instead of specific versions
6. **Overly Pessimistic Versioning**: Pinning to exact versions without room for patches

## Dependency Selection Criteria

When evaluating a new dependency, consider:

### Technical Factors

1. **Feature Match**: How well it meets functional requirements
2. **Performance**: Resource usage and efficiency
3. **Bundle Size**: Impact on application size
4. **API Design**: Quality and intuitiveness of the API
5. **Extensibility**: Ability to extend or customize behavior
6. **Documentation**: Quality and completeness of documentation
7. **Type Definitions**: Availability of type definitions (for typed languages)
8. **Test Coverage**: Extent and quality of test coverage

### Community and Support Factors

1. **Maintenance Activity**: Frequency of updates
2. **Community Size**: Adoption in the developer community
3. **Issue Resolution**: Response time to issues and PRs
4. **Bus Factor**: Number of active maintainers
5. **Commercial Support**: Availability of paid support if needed
6. **Stack Overflow Activity**: Community knowledge base
7. **Release Cadence**: Predictable, well-managed releases

### Organizational Factors

1. **Licensing**: Compliance with organizational license policies
2. **Security History**: Track record of security issues
3. **Alignment**: Strategic fit with technology roadmap
4. **Internal Expertise**: Team familiarity with the dependency
5. **Long-term Viability**: Expected longevity of the dependency

### Decision Matrix Template

| Criteria | Weight | Option 1 | Option 2 | Option 3 |
|----------|--------|----------|----------|----------|
| Feature completeness | High | ★★★★☆ | ★★★☆☆ | ★★★★★ |
| Performance | Medium | ★★★★★ | ★★★★☆ | ★★☆☆☆ |
| Maintenance activity | High | ★★★☆☆ | ★★★★★ | ★★★★☆ |
| Bundle size | Medium | ★★★★☆ | ★★★★★ | ★★☆☆☆ |
| Community support | Medium | ★★★★☆ | ★★★★★ | ★★★☆☆ |
| License compatibility | High | ★★★★★ | ★★★★★ | ★★★★★ |
| Documentation | Medium | ★★★☆☆ | ★★★★★ | ★★★★☆ |
| **TOTAL** | | **75%** | **86%** | **70%** |

## Versioning and Constraints

### Semantic Versioning

All Bayat projects should follow and respect [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) (SemVer):

- **Major version** (`1.0.0`): Incompatible API changes
- **Minor version** (`0.1.0`): Add functionality in a backward-compatible manner
- **Patch version** (`0.0.1`): Backward-compatible bug fixes

### Version Constraints

Use appropriate version constraints based on the stability of the dependency:

| Constraint Type | Example | Use When | Risk Level |
|-----------------|---------|----------|------------|
| Exact | `1.2.3` | For mission-critical dependencies with specific tested versions | Low risk, high stability |
| Patch Range | `1.2.x` or `~1.2.3` | For stable dependencies where patches are low risk | Low-medium risk |
| Minor Range | `1.x` or `^1.2.3` | For reliable dependencies with good backward compatibility | Medium risk |
| Major Range | `>=1.2.3` | Generally not recommended except for development tools | High risk |
| Unbounded | `*` or `latest` | Never use in production code | Extremely high risk |

### Version Resolution Strategy

1. **Lock Files**: Always commit lock files (`package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, `Pipfile.lock`, etc.)
2. **Resolution Strategy**: In case of version conflicts, document the resolution strategy
3. **Peer Dependencies**: Be aware of and document peer dependency requirements

## Dependency Evaluation Framework

Establish a structured framework for evaluating dependencies:

### Initial Evaluation

For new dependencies, complete the Dependency Evaluation Form:

```plaintext
Dependency Evaluation Form
--------------------------
Package Name: 
Purpose: 
Alternative Packages Considered:
Version Selected:
License:
Security Scan Results:
Bundle Size Impact:
Maintenance Activity:
Major Contributors:
Test Coverage:
Documentation Quality:
Breaking Change History:
Approved By:
Date:
```

### Periodic Re-Evaluation

Re-evaluate critical dependencies regularly:

1. **Mission-Critical**: Every 3 months
2. **Important**: Every 6 months
3. **Standard**: Annually

### Health Score Calculation

Calculate a Dependency Health Score using:

- Months since last release (fewer is better)
- Number of open issues vs. closed issues
- Number of active contributors
- Security vulnerabilities history
- Breaking changes frequency
- Test coverage percentage
- Documentation completeness

## Dependency Inventory and Auditing

### Dependency Inventory

Maintain a comprehensive inventory of dependencies:

1. **Direct Dependencies**: Dependencies explicitly included in your project
2. **Transitive Dependencies**: Dependencies of your dependencies
3. **Development Dependencies**: Used only during development
4. **Optional Dependencies**: Used in specific configurations

### Regular Auditing

Perform regular dependency audits:

1. **Security Audit**: Check for known vulnerabilities
2. **License Audit**: Ensure license compliance
3. **Usage Audit**: Identify unused or duplicate dependencies
4. **Update Audit**: Identify outdated dependencies

### Dependency Visualization

Use visualization tools to understand dependency relationships:

1. **Dependency Graphs**: Visualize the hierarchy of dependencies
2. **Impact Analysis**: Understand the impact of updating a specific dependency

## Update Strategies

### Update Frequency

Establish a regular cadence for dependency updates:

1. **Security Updates**: Immediate
2. **Patch Updates**: Monthly
3. **Minor Updates**: Quarterly
4. **Major Updates**: Planned with feature releases

### Update Approaches

Choose the appropriate update approach based on project phase and criticality:

1. **Continuous Updates**: Regularly update to latest compatible versions
   - Best for: Active development, lower criticality systems
   - Advantages: Stay current, avoid large migrations
   - Challenges: Requires good test coverage, more frequent integration work

2. **Scheduled Batch Updates**: Update groups of dependencies on a schedule
   - Best for: Stable systems, medium criticality
   - Advantages: Predictable, controlled impact
   - Challenges: Can create larger change sets

3. **LTS Alignment**: Align with Long-Term Support versions of key dependencies
   - Best for: High criticality systems, regulated environments
   - Advantages: Stability, security, vendor support
   - Challenges: Can fall significantly behind latest features

4. **Feature-Driven Updates**: Update when new features are needed
   - Best for: Mature, feature-stable products
   - Advantages: Clear business justification
   - Challenges: Can accumulate technical debt

### Gradual Rollout Strategy for Major Updates

For major dependency updates, follow a gradual rollout:

1. **Research Phase**: Understand breaking changes and migration path
2. **Prototype Phase**: Create a proof-of-concept with the update
3. **Migration Planning**: Develop a detailed migration plan
4. **Testing Environment**: Apply the update in testing environment
5. **Canary Deployment**: Deploy to a subset of production
6. **Full Rollout**: Complete the migration
7. **Monitoring Period**: Monitor for unexpected issues
8. **Retrospective**: Document lessons learned

## Security Vulnerability Management

### Vulnerability Monitoring

Implement continuous monitoring for security vulnerabilities:

1. **Automated Scans**: Use automated security scanning tools
2. **Vulnerability Databases**: Monitor CVE databases and security advisories
3. **Vendor Security Bulletins**: Subscribe to security notifications from vendors

### Vulnerability Response Process

When a vulnerability is discovered:

1. **Assessment**: Evaluate the severity and applicability
2. **Prioritization**: Prioritize based on CVSS score and exposure
3. **Mitigation**: Apply updates, patches, or workarounds
4. **Verification**: Verify the vulnerability is resolved
5. **Documentation**: Document the response for compliance purposes

### Vulnerability Severity Levels and Response Times

| Severity Level | CVSS Score | Response Time | Update Window |
|----------------|------------|---------------|---------------|
| Critical | 9.0-10.0 | Immediate | 24 hours |
| High | 7.0-8.9 | Within 1 day | 3 days |
| Medium | 4.0-6.9 | Within 1 week | 2 weeks |
| Low | 0.1-3.9 | Within 30 days | Next release |

## Breaking Changes Management

### Breaking Change Identification

Techniques for identifying potential breaking changes:

1. **Release Notes Review**: Thoroughly read release notes for new versions
2. **Changelog Analysis**: Review detailed changelogs
3. **API Comparison**: Use tools to compare API signatures between versions
4. **Test Coverage Analysis**: Identify tests that will verify compatibility

### Pre-Update Impact Analysis

Before applying breaking changes:

1. **Usage Analysis**: Identify where and how the dependency is used
2. **Compatibility Testing**: Test in a controlled environment
3. **Migration Planning**: Document required code changes
4. **Rollback Planning**: Establish a rollback plan

### Post-Update Validation

After applying breaking changes:

1. **Regression Testing**: Run comprehensive regression tests
2. **Integration Testing**: Verify interactions with other components
3. **Performance Testing**: Check for performance regressions
4. **Monitoring**: Implement additional monitoring during transition

kotlin-stdlib = { module = "org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-stdlib", version.ref = "kotlin" }
jackson-databind = { module = "com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind", version.ref = "jackson" }

[bundles]
spring = ["spring-boot-starter", "spring-boot-starter-web"]

[plugins]
spring-boot = { id = "org.springframework.boot", version.ref = "spring-boot" }
kotlin-jvm = { id = "org.jetbrains.kotlin.jvm", version.ref = "kotlin" }
```

### C# and .NET

1. **Package Management**: Use NuGet with PackageReference format
2. **Version Constraints**: Use version ranges with minimum versions
3. **Central Package Management**: Use Directory.Packages.props for multi-project solutions
4. **Tools**: Use NuGet Package Explorer, dotnet outdated

```xml
<!-- Example Directory.Packages.props for centralized versioning -->
<Project>
  <PropertyGroup>
    <ManagePackageVersionsCentrally>true</ManagePackageVersionsCentrally>
  </PropertyGroup>
  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageVersion Include="Microsoft.AspNetCore.App" Version="7.0.0" />
    <PackageVersion Include="Newtonsoft.Json" Version="13.0.3" />
    <PackageVersion Include="Serilog" Version="3.0.1" />
  </ItemGroup>
</Project>

<!-- In individual project files -->
<ItemGroup>
  <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.AspNetCore.App" />
  <PackageReference Include="Newtonsoft.Json" />
</ItemGroup>
```

### Go

1. **Modules**: Use Go modules (go.mod) for dependency management
2. **Version Selection**: Use specific versions or commit hashes
3. **Vendoring**: Consider vendoring dependencies for critical projects
4. **Tools**: Use govulncheck, go mod tidy

```go
// Example go.mod file
module github.com/bayat/project

go 1.20

require (
    github.com/gin-gonic/gin v1.9.1
    github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql v1.7.1
    github.com/sirupsen/logrus v1.9.3
)

// Pin indirect dependencies when necessary
replace (
    github.com/critical-dependency/lib v1.2.3 => github.com/critical-dependency/lib v1.2.4
)
```

### PHP

1. **Composer**: Use Composer with specific version constraints
2. **Platform Requirements**: Define PHP version and extension requirements

    "phpunit/phpunit": "^10.0",
    "phpstan/phpstan": "^1.10"
  },
  "config": {
    "sort-packages": true
  }
}
```

## Monorepo Dependency Management

### Monorepo-Specific Challenges

1. **Version Consistency**: Ensuring consistent versions across packages
2. **Interdependencies**: Managing internal package dependencies
3. **Selective Updates**: Updating dependencies for specific packages
4. **Hoisting**: Handling dependency hoisting to reduce duplication

### Monorepo Best Practices

1. **Centralized Version Management**:
   - Use tools like Lerna, nx, or Yarn workspaces
   - Define shared dependencies in a root configuration
   - Implement version resolution strategies

2. **Dependency Graph Analysis**:
   - Visualize internal dependency relationships
   - Analyze impact of updates on the entire repository
   - Identify circular dependencies

3. **Staged Updates**:
   - Update shared dependencies first
   - Test affected packages
   - Update package-specific dependencies

4. **Release Coordination**:
   - Coordinate releases of interrelated packages
   - Version internal dependencies appropriately
   - Document breaking changes across packages

## Dependencies in CI/CD

### CI/CD Pipeline Integration

1. **Dependency Installation**: Optimize for CI/CD performance
   - Use dependency caching
   - Consider offline installations

   - Run integration tests with latest dependencies

### Dependency-Aware Deployment

1. **Verify Dependencies Before Deployment**:
   - Ensure all dependencies are resolvable
   - Verify dependencies match lock files

2. **Dependency Considerations in Rollback Strategy**:
   - Include dependency state in rollback procedures
   - Test rollbacks with dependency changes

3. **Environment Parity**:
   - Ensure development, staging, and production use identical dependencies
   - Document any environment-specific dependency configurations

## Dependency Documentation

For each project, document:

1. **Core Dependencies List**:
   - Purpose of each major dependency
   - Version selection rationale
   - Alternatives considered

2. **Dependency Update Policy**:
   - Update frequency for different types of dependencies
   - Approval process for updates
   - Testing requirements for updates

3. **Known Issues and Workarounds**:
   - Document known issues with specific versions
   - Include any applied patches or workarounds

4. **Version Constraints Rationale**:
   - Explain unusual version constraints
   - Document version pinning reasons

### Documentation Template

```markdown
# Project Dependencies

## Core Dependencies

| Dependency | Version | Purpose | Alternatives Considered | Update Policy |
|------------|---------|---------|-------------------------|---------------|
| React | ^18.2.0 | UI framework | Vue, Angular | Quarterly minor updates |
| axios | ^1.3.0 | HTTP client | fetch API, SuperAgent | Monthly patch updates |

## Dependency Management

- **Update Schedule**: Security patches immediately, minor versions monthly, major versions quarterly
- **Update Responsibility**: DevOps team handles infrastructure dependencies, development team handles application dependencies
- **Pre-Update Testing**: Full test suite must pass before merging dependency updates

## Known Issues

- **lodash@4.17.19**: Memory leak in `_.debounce()` function. Workaround in `src/utils/debounce.js`
- **webpack@5.70.0**: Incompatible with our custom loaders. Pinned to 5.69.1 until fixed

## Custom Patches

- Applied custom patch to `node_modules/problem-package/index.js` for compatibility. See `patches/problem-package+1.0.0.patch`
```

## Development Dependencies vs. Production Dependencies

### Separating Development and Production Dependencies

1. **Clear Separation**:
   - Clearly separate development and production dependencies
   - Use appropriate configuration in package managers

2. **Development Dependencies**:
   - Testing frameworks and tools
   - Linters and formatters
   - Build tools
   - Development servers
   - Documentation generators

3. **Production Dependencies**:
   - Runtime libraries
   - Application frameworks
   - Data processing libraries
   - API clients

### Environment-Specific Dependencies

1. **Define Environment Tiers**:
   - Development
   - Testing
   - Staging
   - Production

2. **Dependencies by Environment**:
   - Document dependencies used in each environment
   - Validate environment parity for production dependencies

## Self-Hosted vs. Third-Party Services

### Evaluating Self-Hosted Options

When choosing between self-hosted and third-party dependencies:

1. **Evaluation Criteria**:
   - Operational overhead
   - Security implications
   - Cost analysis
   - Reliability requirements

3. **Hybrid Approaches**:
   - Using official Docker images for self-hosting
   - Self-hosting with vendor support
   - Cloud-managed open-source services

## Legacy Project Considerations

### Managing Dependencies in Legacy Projects

1. **Dependency Archaeology**:
   - Document historical dependency decisions
   - Map current dependencies and their interactions

2. **Gradual Modernization Strategy**:
   - Prioritize security updates
   - Create a phased update plan
   - Establish test coverage before major updates

3. **Working with Outdated Dependencies**:
   - Vendor forking strategy when necessary
   - Minimal patching approach
   - Encapsulation to limit exposure to outdated code

### Dealing with Unsupported Dependencies

When a dependency is no longer maintained:

1. **Risk Assessment**:
   - Evaluate security implications
   - Assess functional risks
   - Consider future compatibility issues

2. **Action Plan**:
   - Replace with an alternative
   - Fork and maintain internally
   - Encapsulate and isolate
   - Plan for gradual replacement
