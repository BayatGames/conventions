- Complete lists of features, settings, and options
- Configuration parameters and their effects
- Input/output specifications
- Error messages and troubleshooting

### FAQ and Troubleshooting

Help for common issues and questions:

### Release Notes

Information about new releases and updates:

- Version number and release date
- New features and enhancements
- Bug fixes
- Known issues
- Migration instructions when relevant

## Documentation Structure

### Standard Structure

All user documentation should follow a consistent structure:

1. **Title**: Clear, descriptive title of the document
2. **Overview**: Brief summary of what the document covers
3. **Prerequisites**: Any requirements or prior knowledge needed
4. **Table of Contents**: For documents longer than a few sections
5. **Main Content**: Organized into logical sections and subsections
6. **Conclusion/Summary**: Brief recap of key points
7. **Related Resources**: Links to related documentation
8. **Glossary**: Definitions of key terms (when needed)
9. **Revision History**: Document version and update information

### Information Hierarchy

Organize content using a clear hierarchy:

- Group related information together
- Place most important information first
- Use consistent heading levels (H1 → H2 → H3)
- Include navigation aids for longer documents
- Create logical paths through the documentation

### Document Templates

Use standardized templates for consistency:

- Maintain templates for each document type
- Include placeholder text and formatting examples
- Provide clear instructions for template usage
- Enforce template usage through documentation review

## Writing Style and Tone

### Voice and Tone

Write with a consistent voice across all documentation:

- **Friendly but professional**: Conversational without being overly casual
- **Helpful not condescending**: Assume user competence without being technical
- **Clear and direct**: Straightforward instructions without ambiguity
- **Positive**: Focus on what users can do, not limitations
- **Inclusive**: Avoid gender-specific terms and cultural assumptions

### Writing Guidelines

Follow these writing standards:

- Write in present tense ("Click the button" not "You will click the button")
- Use active voice ("Click Save" not "The Save button should be clicked")
- Address the user directly ("You can configure..." or "Configure...")
- Use simple, concise language (avoid jargon unless necessary)
- Define technical terms when first used
- Keep sentences and paragraphs short and focused
- Use consistent terminology throughout

### Language Conventions

Standardize language conventions:

- **UI elements**: Bold (e.g., "Click the **Save** button")
- **User input**: Monospace (e.g., "Type `hello` in the field")
- **Code**: Code blocks with syntax highlighting
- **File names and paths**: Monospace (e.g., `config.json`)
- **Variables**: Italics or specific formatting (e.g., *username*)
- **Important notes**: Highlighted using callouts or warning boxes

## Visual Elements

### Screenshots and Images

Include visual aids with these guidelines:

- Use screenshots to illustrate complex interfaces
- Capture the minimum necessary area to show the relevant UI
- Highlight important areas using annotations
- Maintain consistent image resolution and quality
- Use platform-appropriate styling (e.g., OS-specific windows)
- Update screenshots when UI changes

Example screenshot guidelines:

```
Screenshot Requirements:
- Resolution: 1920x1080 (scaled as needed)
- Format: PNG with transparent background when possible
- Annotations: Red rectangles for highlights (2px width)
- Text callouts: Roboto 14pt, #FF0000
- Blur sensitive information (personal data, keys, etc.)
```

### Videos and Animations

For dynamic content:

- Keep videos short and focused (ideally under 2 minutes)
- Include captions and transcripts
- Use consistent intro/outro branding
- Host on consistent platforms (YouTube, Vimeo)
- Provide alternative text-based instructions

### Diagrams and Charts

For complex concepts:

- Use standardized diagramming styles
- Include legends for symbols and colors
- Ensure diagrams are accessible (use text labels)
- Make diagrams culture-neutral
- Follow brand color guidelines

## Accessibility Standards

Ensure documentation is accessible to all users:

- Adhere to WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- Provide alternative text for all images
- Ensure proper heading structure for screen readers
- Use sufficient color contrast
- Avoid relying solely on color to convey information
- Make sure all content is keyboard navigable
- Provide transcripts for audio/video content
- Test with accessibility tools

## Localization and Translation

Guidelines for multi-language documentation:

- Design with translation in mind
- Avoid culture-specific references and idioms
- Use simple, clear sentence structures
- Separate text from graphics for easier translation
- Maintain glossaries for consistent term translation
- Allow for text expansion (~30% longer in other languages)
- Include locale in document naming (e.g., user-guide-en-us.pdf)
- Test document layout with translated content

## Documentation Formats

### Web Documentation

For online documentation:

- Use responsive design for all devices
- Implement robust search functionality
- Create logical navigation hierarchies
- Use consistent URL structures
- Optimize for both browsing and direct linking
- Include version selectors for multi-version documentation
- Support dark/light mode options
- Enable offline access where appropriate

### PDF Documentation

For downloadable documentation:

- Create bookmarks and table of contents
- Include page numbers and document metadata
- Optimize file size
- Ensure proper tagging for accessibility
- Use vector graphics where possible
