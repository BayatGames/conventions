## Testing and Monitoring

### Performance Testing Types

- Load testing (steady load)
- Stress testing (beyond normal capacity)
- Spike testing (sudden increases)
- Endurance testing (sustained period)
- Scalability testing (increasing resources)
- Component testing (isolated components)

### Monitoring Requirements

- Implement real user monitoring (RUM)
- Set up synthetic monitoring for critical paths
- Monitor backend performance metrics
- Implement alerting for performance degradation
- Use distributed tracing for request flow analysis
- Perform regular performance audits

## Implementation Process

1. **Requirements Phase**: Define specific performance requirements
2. **Design Phase**: Review design decisions for performance impact
