# Accessibility Standards

This document outlines the accessibility standards that all Bayat products must adhere to.

## Compliance Standards

All Bayat projects must comply with:

- **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA**
- **Section 508** of the Rehabilitation Act (for U.S. government-related projects)
- **ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act)** requirements
- **EN 301 549** (for European projects)

## Core Principles

Our accessibility approach follows the four core principles of WCAG:

1. **Perceivable**: Information must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive
2. **Operable**: User interface components must be operable by all users
3. **Understandable**: Information and operation must be understandable
4. **Robust**: Content must be robust enough to be interpreted by a variety of user agents

## Technical Requirements

### Visual Design

- Maintain a color contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text
- Never use color alone to convey information
- Provide visible focus indicators for keyboard navigation
- Ensure text can be resized up to 200% without loss of content or functionality
- Design with responsive principles to support zooming and different viewport sizes

### Navigation and Interaction

- Ensure all functionality is accessible via keyboard
- Provide skip navigation links for screen reader users
- Implement proper focus management for dynamic content
- Ensure interactive elements have appropriate size targets (minimum 44x44px)
- Allow sufficient time for users to read and interact with content
- Avoid content that flashes more than three times per second

### Content Structure

- Use semantic HTML elements (e.g., `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, etc.)
- Implement proper heading hierarchy (H1-H6)
- Use lists (`<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<dl>`) for list content
- Provide descriptive, unique page titles
- Ensure logical reading order in the DOM

### Forms

- Associate labels with form controls using `<label>` elements
- Group related form elements with `<fieldset>` and `<legend>`
- Provide clear error messages and suggestions for correction
- Ensure form validation is accessible and understandable
- Support autocomplete for common form fields

### Images and Media

- Provide alternative text for all non-decorative images
- Use empty alt attributes for decorative images (`alt=""`)
- Include captions and transcripts for audio and video content
- Ensure media controls are keyboard accessible
- Avoid auto-playing audio or video without user control

### Tables

- Use proper table markup with `<th>` for headers
- Include proper scope attributes for header cells
- Provide captions and summaries for complex tables
- Avoid using tables for layout purposes

### Dynamic Content

- Use ARIA roles, states, and properties appropriately
- Ensure screen readers are notified of dynamic content changes
- Make modal dialogs fully accessible
- Provide status messages in an accessible manner
- Test custom widgets with screen readers

## Testing Requirements

All products must undergo the following accessibility testing:

1. **Automated testing** using tools like:
   - Axe
   - WAVE
   - Lighthouse
   - SiteImprove

2. **Manual testing** including:
   - Keyboard-only navigation testing
   - Screen reader testing (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
   - High contrast mode testing
   - Testing at 200% zoom

3. **User testing** with people with disabilities when possible

See [Frontend Testing Standards](docs/quality/frontend-testing.md#accessibility-testing) for detailed testing guidance.

## Documentation Requirements

Every project must include:

- Accessibility compliance statement
- Known accessibility issues and workarounds
- Accessibility testing results
- VPAT (Voluntary Product Accessibility Template) for enterprise products

## Implementation Process

1. **Requirements Phase**: Define accessibility requirements for the project
2. **Design Phase**: Review designs for accessibility issues
3. **Development Phase**: Implement accessible code
4. **Testing Phase**: Conduct accessibility testing
5. **Release Phase**: Document accessibility features and known issues
6. **Maintenance Phase**: Address accessibility issues in future releases

## Responsibility Assignment

- **Product Managers**: Ensure accessibility requirements are included in specifications
- **Designers**: Create accessible designs
- **Developers**: Implement accessible code
- **QA Engineers**: Test for accessibility issues
- **Project Managers**: Schedule accessibility testing and remediation
