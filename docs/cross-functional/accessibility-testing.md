## Introduction

### Purpose

Accessibility testing ensures our products are usable by people with disabilities and meets regulatory requirements. This includes verifying that products are:

- Perceivable: Information is presented in ways all users can perceive
- Operable: Interface components are navigable and usable by all
- Understandable: Information and operation are clear and consistent
- Robust: Content is compatible with current and future assistive technologies

### Business Importance

- **Legal Compliance**: Meet requirements like ADA, Section 508, and AODA
- **Market Reach**: Serve the 15-20% of the population with disabilities
- **Brand Reputation**: Demonstrate commitment to inclusivity
- **Better UX for Everyone**: Accessibility improvements benefit all users
- **Cost Efficiency**: Early detection reduces remediation costs

## Accessibility Standards

### Primary Standards

| Standard | Applicability | Compliance Level |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|
| WCAG 2.1 | All digital products | AA (minimum) |
| Section 508 | US federal agencies and contractors | Required for government work |
| EN 301 549 | EU digital products | Required for EU operations |
| ADA | US-based products and services | Required for US operations |

### Standard Interpretation

- Refer to [WCAG Understanding Documents](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/) for official interpretations
- Apply the POUR principles (Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, Robust)
- When conflicts arise between standards, apply the more stringent requirement

## Testing Approach

### Testing Pyramid

Our accessibility testing follows a pyramid approach:

1. **Foundation**: Automated testing for high coverage of basic issues
2. **Middle**: Manual expert testing for more complex issues
3. **Top**: Assistive technology testing and testing with users with disabilities

### Risk-Based Prioritization

Prioritize testing based on:

- Criticality of the feature
- User impact of potential accessibility issues
- Complexity of the interface
- Likelihood of accessibility issues based on technology used

### Testing Frequency

| Development Stage | Testing Type | Frequency |
|-------------------|--------------|-----------|
| Design | Accessibility reviews | Every major design iteration |
| Development | Automated testing | Continuous/daily |
| Development | Developer manual tests | For complex components |
| Sprint completion | Accessibility testing | Each sprint |
| Pre-release | Full accessibility audit | Before each major release |
| Post-release | Ongoing monitoring | Monthly |

## Automated Testing

### Tools by Platform

| Platform | Primary Tools | Secondary Tools |
|----------|--------------|-----------------|
| Web | Axe-core, Lighthouse | WAVE, Pa11y |
| iOS | Xcode Accessibility Inspector | XCUITest with accessibility |
| Android | Accessibility Scanner, Espresso | TalkBack automated tests |
| Windows | Accessibility Insights | Windows Narrator API tests |
| PDF | PAC 3, Adobe Acrobat Pro | PDF Accessibility Checker |

### Automation in CI/CD

- Integrate accessibility testing in CI/CD pipelines
- Break builds for critical accessibility issues (WCAG Level A)
- Flag warnings for Level AA issues
- Generate accessibility reports with each build
- Track accessibility debt over time

### Automated Test Coverage

Ensure automated tests check for:

- Proper heading structure
- Alternative text for images
- Color contrast ratios
- Form labels and instructions
- Keyboard focus indicators
- ARIA usage and landmark regions
- Reading order and tab order
- Frame titles
- Language settings

## Manual Testing

### Test Protocols

Develop systematic manual test protocols for:

1. **Keyboard Navigation**:
   - Tab order follows logical sequence
   - Focus is clearly visible at all times
   - No keyboard traps
   - All functionality is keyboard accessible
   - Shortcut keys don't conflict with assistive technology

2. **Content Structure**:
   - Proper heading hierarchy
   - Meaningful link text
   - Lists used appropriately
   - Tables have proper headers
   - Reading order is logical

3. **Visual Design**:
   - Text resizes without loss of content
   - Content reflows on zoom
   - Interface works in different orientations
   - Content readable at high contrast

4. **Multimedia**:
   - Captions for video content
   - Transcripts for audio
   - Audio descriptions when needed
   - Controls are accessible

### Test Cases

Document specific test cases for:

- User login and authentication
- Form submission processes
- Navigation systems
- Search functionality
- Media players
- Interactive elements (dropdowns, tabs, modals)
- Data visualization components
- Notification systems

### Checklists

Use detailed checklists by component type:

- Forms and form controls
- Navigation menus
- Modal dialogs
- Carousels
- Auto-complete widgets
- Date pickers
- Custom components

## Assistive Technology Testing

### Required Assistive Technologies

| Platform | Primary AT | Secondary AT |
|----------|------------|--------------|
| Windows | NVDA | JAWS, Windows Narrator |
| macOS | VoiceOver | |
| iOS | VoiceOver | Switch Control |
| Android | TalkBack | Switch Access |
| All | Keyboard only | Voice control |

### Testing Methodology

For each assistive technology:

1. Create user flows for key tasks
2. Document expected behavior
3. Test using assistive technology
4. Document actual behavior
5. Identify and report discrepancies

### Assistive Technology Matrix

Maintain a compatibility matrix showing:

- Which assistive technologies are supported
- Level of support for each feature
- Known limitations
- Workarounds for issues

## User Testing

### Participant Recruitment

- Partner with disability organizations
- Build a diverse panel of users with disabilities
- Ensure representation across disability types:
  - Visual impairments
  - Mobility impairments
  - Cognitive disabilities
  - Hearing impairments
  - Speech disabilities

### Test Protocols

1. **Planning**:
   - Define clear test objectives
   - Create realistic scenarios
   - Select appropriate participants
   - Prepare accessible test materials

2. **Execution**:
   - Set up accessible testing environment
   - Provide multiple communication options
   - Allow extra time if needed
   - Record sessions (with consent)

3. **Analysis**:
   - Document barriers encountered
   - Categorize issues by severity
   - Map issues to WCAG criteria
   - Identify patterns across participants

### Remote vs. In-person Testing

Guidelines for both approaches:

- **Remote**:
  - Ensure testing platform is accessible
  - Test connection and AT compatibility before session
  - Have backup communication channels
  - Provide clear instructions in advance

- **In-person**:
  - Ensure physical accessibility of testing location
  - Allow participants to use their own AT when possible
  - Be prepared to provide accommodations
  - Create a comfortable environment

## Reporting and Documentation

### Issue Documentation

Document each issue with:

- Description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce
- Impact on users
- Related WCAG criteria
- Severity rating
- Screenshots/recordings
- Assistive technology affected
- Recommended solution

### Severity Classification

| Severity | Definition | Response Time |
|----------|------------|---------------|
| Critical | Prevents task completion for users with disabilities | Immediate fix required |
| High | Significantly impairs user experience but has workarounds | Fix in current sprint |
| Medium | Causes difficulty but doesn't prevent task completion | Schedule for near-term fix |
| Low | Minor inconvenience or technical violation with minimal impact | Add to backlog |

### Report Templates

Standard report sections:

1. **Executive Summary**:
   - Overall compliance status
   - Key findings
   - Risk assessment
   - Recommended priorities

2. **Methodology**:
   - Standards applied
   - Testing tools used
   - Testing approach
   - Environments tested

3. **Detailed Findings**:
   - Categorized by severity
   - Mapped to WCAG criteria
   - Affected user groups
   - Impact descriptions

4. **Remediation Plan**:
   - Recommended fixes
   - Resource requirements
   - Proposed timeline
   - Success criteria

## Remediation Process

### Prioritization Framework

Prioritize remediation based on:

1. Impact on users
2. Severity of the issue
3. Frequency of feature use
4. Technical complexity of the fix
5. Regulatory requirements

### Fix Verification

For each remediated issue:

1. Retest using the same method that identified the issue
2. Verify fix works across all relevant platforms
3. Ensure fix doesn't introduce new accessibility issues
4. Document the resolution and update status

### Knowledge Sharing
