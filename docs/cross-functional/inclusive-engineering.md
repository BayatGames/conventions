# Inclusive Engineering Practices

## Introduction

Inclusive engineering involves creating systems, products, and code that consider and serve diverse users, communities, and team members. This document outlines practices for building more inclusive software products and fostering an inclusive engineering culture.

## Inclusive Product Design

### User Research

- Include diverse participants in user research
- Consider different perspectives, abilities, backgrounds, and contexts
- Identify and mitigate bias in research questions and methodologies
- Validate findings with users from underrepresented groups

### Personas and Use Cases

- Create diverse personas that represent your entire user base
- Consider contextual factors (device access, connectivity, language)
- Include edge cases related to accessibility and international use
- Document anti-personas to understand who might be excluded

### Feature Prioritization

- Consider impact on diverse user groups in prioritization frameworks
- Evaluate features from an equity perspective
- Avoid implementing features that only benefit the majority
- Balance business needs with inclusive design requirements

## Inclusive UI/UX Design

### Visual Design

- Ensure sufficient color contrast (WCAG AA minimum, AAA preferred)
- Don't rely solely on color to convey information
- Use flexible layouts that adapt to different text sizes and screen dimensions
- Test designs with different display settings and assistive technologies

### Content Design

- Use plain, clear language
- Avoid idioms, colloquialisms, and culturally specific references
- Create content that respects diverse cultural perspectives
- Consider translation and localization requirements early

### Interaction Design

- Provide multiple ways to interact (mouse, keyboard, touch, voice)
- Support assistive technology standards
- Design for various input methods and abilities
- Test interactions with diverse user groups

### Design Systems

- Build accessibility into design system components
- Document accessibility requirements for components
- Include diverse imagery in style guides
- Implement responsive design principles

## Inclusive Coding Practices

### Variable and Function Naming

- Use inclusive terminology in code
- Avoid terms with negative historical contexts
- Replace problematic terms in legacy code
- Consider cultural connotations of metaphors and naming

### Code Comments and Documentation

- Write clear comments accessible to non-native English speakers
- Document accessibility features and considerations
- Include diverse examples in code samples
- Explain why accessibility features are implemented

### Git and Version Control

- Write inclusive commit messages
- Use inclusive terminology in branch naming
- Document accessibility-related changes clearly
- Include diverse voices in code reviews

### Testing and Quality Assurance

- Include accessibility testing in QA processes
- Test with assistive technologies and browser extensions
- Create test cases for diverse user scenarios
- Document accessibility compliance requirements

## Technical Implementation for Inclusion

### Accessibility Implementation

- Follow WCAG guidelines (minimum AA compliance)
- Implement proper semantic HTML
- Use ARIA attributes appropriately
- Ensure keyboard navigability
- Implement focus management for custom components

### Internationalization (i18n)

- Separate UI text from code
- Support right-to-left languages
- Implement Unicode correctly
- Account for text expansion in translations
- Support different date, time, and number formats

### Performance Considerations

- Optimize for low-end devices
- Design for unreliable or low-bandwidth connections
- Implement progressive enhancement
- Create offline capabilities where appropriate

### Privacy and Security

- Implement inclusive data collection practices
- Consider privacy needs of vulnerable populations
- Provide clear control over personal data
- Design authentication with diverse needs in mind

## Inclusive Development Environment

### Team Composition

- Build diverse engineering teams
- Create inclusive hiring processes
- Support retention of underrepresented groups
- Promote equitable advancement opportunities

### Collaboration Practices

- Establish inclusive meeting practices
- Create multiple channels for input and feedback
- Document decisions for asynchronous participation
- Respect different communication styles

### Knowledge Sharing

- Make documentation accessible to team members with different experience levels
- Create mentorship opportunities for underrepresented groups
- Recognize and credit diverse contributions
- Share context and institutional knowledge widely

### Work Environment

- Support flexible work arrangements
- Create accommodations for different needs
- Establish inclusive team events and activities
- Provide equitable access to tools and resources

## Measuring Inclusion

### Metrics and Monitoring

- Track accessibility compliance
- Monitor internationalization coverage
- Collect feedback from diverse user groups
- Analyze usage patterns across different demographics

### Regular Audits

- Conduct regular accessibility audits
- Review code for inclusive terminology
- Audit documentation for clarity and inclusivity
- Review user journeys for different personas

### Continuous Improvement

- Create actionable plans based on audit results
- Prioritize inclusion-related improvements
- Track progress over time
- Celebrate inclusive design wins

## Appendix: Terminology Guidelines

### Inclusive Terminology Recommendations

| Avoid | Use Instead | Context |
|-------|------------|---------|
| Master/slave | Primary/secondary, main/replica | Database and system relationships |
| Whitelist/blacklist | Allowlist/denylist, permit/block | Security and access control |
| Grandfathered | Legacy status, previously qualified | Policy exceptions |
| Sanity check | Quick check, confidence check, coherence check | Testing and verification |
| Dummy value | Placeholder, sample, example | Test data |
| Native feature | Built-in feature, standard feature | Product capabilities |
| Crippled | Limited, restricted | Feature limitations |

### Guidelines for Creating New Terms

- Consider multiple cultural and linguistic contexts
- Avoid terms with negative historical or cultural associations
- Use descriptive, functional language
- Test terminology with diverse reviewers
- Document reasoning behind terminology choices
