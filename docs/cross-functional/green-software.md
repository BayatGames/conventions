# Green Software Engineering Standards

This document outlines the standards and best practices for environmentally sustainable software development at Bayat.

## Principles

### Core Principles
- **Carbon Efficiency**: Emit the least carbon possible
- **Energy Efficiency**: Use the least amount of energy possible
- **Carbon Awareness**: Do more when the electricity is cleaner
- **Hardware Efficiency**: Use the least amount of hardware possible
- **Measurement**: What you can't measure, you can't improve

## Development Practices

### Code Efficiency
1. **Algorithm Optimization**:
   - Prefer algorithms with lower computational complexity
   - Reduce unnecessary iterations and operations
   - Use appropriate data structures to minimize processing
   - Implement lazy loading and lazy computation patterns

2. **Resource Management**:
   - Implement efficient memory usage patterns
   - Release resources promptly when no longer needed
   - Minimize network calls and data transfers
   - Optimize database queries and data access patterns

3. **Idle Resources**:
   - Implement sleep modes for inactive components
   - Scale down or shut down unused services
   - Use event-driven architecture to minimize polling
   - Implement efficient background processing

### Application Design
1. **Energy-Aware UX**:
   - Design dark mode interfaces by default
   - Minimize animations and transitions on battery-powered devices
   - Implement reduced motion and low-power modes
   - Design interfaces that require fewer interactions to complete tasks

2. **Network Efficiency**:
   - Implement effective caching strategies
   - Compress data for transmission
   - Use efficient data formats (JSON vs. XML, Protocol Buffers, etc.)
   - Batch API requests to reduce connection overhead

3. **Sustainable Design Patterns**:
   - Implement pagination to limit data processing
   - Use virtualization for large data sets
   - Implement incremental loading patterns
   - Design for offline-first where appropriate

## Infrastructure

### Cloud Resources
1. **Right-sizing**:
   - Guidelines for appropriate instance sizing
   - Auto-scaling configuration best practices
   - Scheduling for non-production environments
   - Serverless vs. container vs. VM selection criteria

2. **Region Selection**:
   - Criteria for selecting regions with lower carbon intensity
   - Multi-region strategy considering energy sources
   - Data locality to reduce transmission energy
   - Carbon-aware deployment strategies

### Data Management
1. **Data Lifecycle**:
   - Data retention policies to minimize storage
   - Tiered storage strategies for energy efficiency
   - Data compression and deduplication requirements
   - Archive guidelines for rarely accessed data

2. **Database Optimization**:
   - Index optimization standards
   - Partitioning strategies for efficient queries
   - Connection pooling requirements
   - Read replica usage guidelines

## Measurement and Reporting

### Carbon Metrics
- Tools and methodologies for measuring software carbon intensity
- Required metrics for application carbon footprint
- Benchmarking standards for energy consumption
- Dashboard requirements for environmental impact

### Reporting Requirements
- Periodic energy consumption reporting
- Carbon reduction goal setting
- Efficiency improvements tracking
- Environmental impact documentation

## Continuous Improvement

### Optimization Process
