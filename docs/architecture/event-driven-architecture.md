# Event-Driven Architecture Patterns

## Introduction

Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) is an architectural pattern where components communicate through events. This document outlines standards and best practices for implementing event-driven architectures across Bayat projects, ensuring scalable, loosely coupled, and resilient systems.

## Core Principles

### Event-Centricity

- Model business activities and changes as events
- Design systems around event production, detection, and reaction
- Separate event creation from event handling
- Use events as the primary means of component communication
- Store events as the system of record when appropriate

### Loose Coupling

- Minimize dependencies between components
- Ensure event producers have no knowledge of consumers
- Allow independent deployment of producers and consumers
- Enable technology heterogeneity
- Support independent scaling of components

### Temporal Decoupling

- Enable asynchronous communication patterns
- Remove time dependencies between components
- Buffer events during activity spikes
- Handle consumer unavailability gracefully
- Support catch-up processing of events

### Resilience

- Design for partial system availability
- Implement graceful degradation during failures
- Use event sourcing for reliable state reconstruction
- Ensure replay capability for recovery scenarios
- Design components to be eventually consistent

## Event Fundamentals

### Event Definition

- **Event**: An immutable record of something that has happened in the system

#### Event Anatomy

- Unique identifier
- Event type
- Timestamp
- Source identifier
- Payload data
- Metadata (correlation ID, version, etc.)
- Schema identifier

#### Event Types

- **Domain Events**: Represent business activities or state changes
- **Integration Events**: Used for communication between bounded contexts
- **System Events**: Represent technical or infrastructure occurrences
- **Command Events**: Request actions to be performed
- **Query Events**: Request information retrieval

### Event Schema Design

- Define clear, consistent schema structures
- Use versioning for schema evolution
- Consider backward/forward compatibility
- Document event purpose and usage
- Include enough context for consumers

#### Schema Evolution Strategies

- Forward compatibility (new producers, old consumers)
- Backward compatibility (old producers, new consumers)
- Schema registry for version management
- Deprecation periods for schema changes
- Version identifiers in events

## Core Patterns

### Event Sourcing

- Store state changes as a sequence of events
- Reconstruct state by replaying events
- Maintain complete audit history
- Support point-in-time reconstruction
- Enable alternative projections

#### Implementation Considerations

- Event store performance characteristics
- Snapshotting for performance optimization
- Handling domain model evolution
- Concurrency control
- State reconstruction process

### Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)

- Separate write operations from read operations
- Optimize command and query models independently
- Use events to update read models
- Support specialized read models for different use cases
- Allow optimized query performance

#### Implementation Considerations

- Consistency models between read and write sides
- Eventual consistency management
- Read model update strategies
- Caching considerations
- Query optimization techniques

### Event-Carried State Transfer

- Include necessary state within events
- Reduce need for additional service calls
- Enable stateless event processing
- Support audit and replay capabilities
- Balance event size with processing efficiency

### Saga Pattern

- Coordinate transactions spanning multiple services
- Implement compensating transactions for rollback
- Use events to trigger each step in the saga
- Support long-running business processes
- Handle partial failures gracefully

#### Implementation Approaches

- **Choreography**: Services react to events from other services
- **Orchestration**: Central coordinator manages the process flow
- **Hybrid**: Combination of choreography and orchestration

## Event Communication Patterns

### Publish-Subscribe

- Publishers emit events without knowledge of subscribers
- Subscribers receive events they've expressed interest in
- Support many-to-many communication
- Enable runtime subscriber registration/deregistration
- Decouple event producers and consumers

### Request-Response over Events

- Implement request-response interactions asynchronously
- Use correlation IDs to match responses with requests
- Set appropriate timeouts for responses
- Handle missing responses gracefully
- Consider alternatives for latency-sensitive operations

### Event Streaming

- Process continuous flows of events
- Support real-time analytics and monitoring
- Enable temporal event processing (windows, sessions)
- Implement stateful stream processing when needed
- Provide replay capabilities

### Work Queue

- Distribute tasks among multiple worker instances
- Ensure exactly-once processing semantics when required
- Support priority-based processing
- Implement dead letter queues for failed processing
- Monitor queue depths and processing latency

## Implementation Patterns

### Event Broker Topology

#### Centralized Broker

```plaintext
┌───────────┐     ┌───────────────┐     ┌───────────┐
│ Producer A│────▶│  Event Broker │────▶│Consumer 1 │
└───────────┘     │               │     └───────────┘
                  │               │
┌───────────┐     │               │     ┌───────────┐
│ Producer B│────▶│               │────▶│Consumer 2 │
└───────────┘     └───────────────┘     └───────────┘
```

#### Distributed Broker

```plaintext
┌───────────┐     ┌───────────────┐     ┌───────────┐
│ Producer A│────▶│  Broker Node 1│────▶│Consumer 1 │
└───────────┘     └───────┬───────┘     └───────────┘
                          │
                          ▼
┌───────────┐     ┌───────────────┐     ┌───────────┐
│ Producer B│────▶│  Broker Node 2│────▶│Consumer 2 │
└───────────┘     └───────────────┘     └───────────┘
```

#### Multi-Cluster

```plaintext
┌───────────────────────┐     ┌───────────────────────┐
│     Cluster A         │     │     Cluster B         │
│  ┌───────┐  ┌───────┐ │     │ ┌───────┐  ┌───────┐  │
│  │Broker1│──│Broker2│ │     │ │Broker1│──│Broker2│  │
│  └───────┘  └───────┘ │     │ └───────┘  └───────┘  │
└─────────┬─────────────┘     └─────────┬─────────────┘
          │                             │
          └──────────┬──────────────────┘
                     │
                     ▼
          ┌────────────────────┐
          │   Replication     │
          └────────────────────┘
