   - Risk assessment guidelines

2. **Business Value Assessment**:
   - Functionality mapping requirements
   - Value stream analysis
   - User journey documentation
   - Business process impact analysis

3. **Stakeholder Analysis**:
   - User impact assessment
   - Stakeholder mapping guidelines
   - Resistance management planning
   - Communication strategy framework

### Modernization Strategy
1. **Strategy Selection**:
   - Criteria for choosing between rehost, refactor, rearchitect, rebuild, or replace
   - Cost-benefit analysis framework
   - Risk assessment methodology
   - Timeline planning guidelines

2. **Roadmap Development**:
   - Phased approach planning
