## AI Systems Architecture

### System Design Principles

- **Modularity**: Design AI systems as a collection of independent, replaceable components
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clearly separate data processing, model training, and inference systems
- **Scalability**: Design for scale from the beginning, considering both data volume and request throughput
- **Observability**: Implement comprehensive logging, monitoring, and tracing at all levels
- **Reproducibility**: Design systems that enable reproducible experiments and outputs
- **Graceful Degradation**: Implement fallback mechanisms for when ML models fail or perform poorly

### Reference Architecture
