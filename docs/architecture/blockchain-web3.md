# Blockchain and Web3 Development Standards

This document outlines the standards and best practices for blockchain and Web3 development projects at Bayat.

## Technology Selection

### Smart Contract Platforms
- **Ethereum**: Primary platform for DeFi and NFT projects
- **Solana**: For high-throughput applications requiring low transaction fees
- **Polygon**: For Ethereum-compatible projects requiring lower gas fees
- **Other EVM-compatible chains**: Based on specific project requirements

### Smart Contract Languages
- **Solidity**: Primary language for Ethereum and EVM-compatible chains
- **Rust**: For Solana development
- **Move**: For specific use cases on supported chains

## Development Practices

### Smart Contract Security
1. **Audit Requirements**:
   - All production contracts must undergo at least one professional audit
   - Internal security review before external audit
   - Automated analysis using tools like Slither, Mythril, or Echidna

2. **Secure Patterns**:
   - Use the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern to prevent reentrancy
   - Implement access control using OpenZeppelin's AccessControl or similar
   - Never use tx.origin for authentication
   - Always check function return values

3. **Gas Optimization**:
   - Pack variables to minimize storage slots
   - Use memory instead of storage where appropriate
   - Optimize loops to reduce gas costs
   - Consider batch operations for multiple state changes

### Testing
1. **Coverage Requirements**:
   - Minimum 95% code coverage for all smart contracts
   - Include unit, integration, and scenario-based tests
   - Test edge cases and potential attack vectors

2. **Testing Environment**:
   - Use Hardhat/Foundry for Ethereum development
   - Use Anchor for Solana development
   - Implement mainnet forking tests for DeFi interactions

### Frontend Integration
1. **Wallet Connections**:
   - Support multiple wallets (MetaMask, WalletConnect, etc.)
   - Implement proper error handling for failed transactions
   - Provide clear transaction status feedback

2. **Transaction Management**:
   - Implement proper nonce management
   - Handle gas estimation and potential gas price fluctuations
   - Provide transaction acceleration options

## Architecture Patterns

### On-chain vs. Off-chain
- Clear separation of concerns between on-chain and off-chain components
- Minimize on-chain storage and computation to reduce costs
- Document hybrid architecture decisions and trade-offs

### Upgradeability
- Default to immutable contracts when possible
- For upgradeable contracts, use the proxy pattern (EIP-1967 or similar)
- Document upgrade procedures and governance processes

### Interoperability
- Follow standards (ERC-20, ERC-721, etc.) for maximum compatibility
- Document cross-chain interaction patterns when applicable
- Standardize interface implementations

## Documentation

### Contract Documentation
- NatSpec comments for all public and external functions and state variables
- Architecture diagrams showing contract interactions
- Clear description of state machine transitions when applicable

### User Documentation
- Clear explanations of transactions and their implications
- Gas cost estimates for common operations
- Security considerations for end-users

## Deployment

### Deployment Process
- Multi-signature requirement for production deployments
- Deployment verification and post-deployment testing
- Contract verification on block explorers

### Environment Strategy
- Development: Local blockchain or testnet
- Staging: Public testnet (Goerli, Mumbai, etc.)
- Production: Mainnet

## Maintenance

### Monitoring
- Event monitoring for critical contract events
- Price monitoring for oracles and assets
- Gas price monitoring for transaction optimization

### Incident Response
- Documented incident response procedures
- Circuit breaker patterns for emergency situations
- Communication templates for security incidents

## Governance

### Decentralized Governance
- Guidelines for DAO implementation when applicable
- Voting mechanism standards
- Proposal and execution flows

## Compliance

### Regulatory Considerations
- Region-specific compliance requirements
- KYC/AML integration standards when required
- Data privacy considerations
