# Platform Engineering Guidelines

## Introduction

Platform Engineering focuses on building and maintaining internal developer platforms that improve developer experience, productivity, and software delivery capabilities. This document outlines standards and best practices for designing, implementing, and evolving internal developer platforms within Bayat projects.

## Core Principles

### Self-Service by Design

- Enable developers to provision resources without dependency on platform teams
- Provide intuitive interfaces for common developer workflows
- Automate repetitive tasks and reduce cognitive load
- Design for minimal friction in the developer journey
- Balance self-service with appropriate governance

### Golden Paths

- Create opinionated, well-supported paths for common workflows
- Document clear entry points for different developer journeys
- Balance standardization with flexibility for edge cases
- Ensure golden paths evolve based on developer feedback
- Support deviation from golden paths when necessary

### Internal Developer Portal

- Provide a single entry point for developer services and resources
- Centralize documentation, tools, and service catalogs
- Implement service ownership and metadata management
- Support discoverability of internal services and APIs
- Integrate monitoring and operational insights

### Platform as a Product

- Treat internal platforms as products with users (developers)
- Apply product management principles to platform development
- Define clear platform roadmaps and prioritization framework
- Establish feedback loops with platform consumers
- Measure platform adoption and effectiveness

## Platform Components

- High maintenance burden

**After Platform Engineering:**

- Standardized pipeline templates for common use cases
