## Introduction

The Tech Radar is a tool to inspire and support teams to pick the best technologies for new projects; it provides a platform to share knowledge and experience in technologies, to reflect on technology decisions and continuously evolve our technology landscape.

## How to Use the Tech Radar

The Tech Radar should be consulted when:

1. Starting a new project
2. Evaluating technologies for an existing project
3. Planning technology upgrades or migrations
4. Making strategic technical decisions

The Tech Radar is not:

- A mandate or strict policy
- A comprehensive list of all technologies used at Bayat
- A replacement for detailed evaluation in your specific context

## Radar Rings

Technologies on the radar are positioned in one of four rings:

### 1. Adopt

**Definition**: Technologies we have high confidence in and recommend using.

**Characteristics**:

- Proven in production at Bayat
- Well-understood
- Mature ecosystem
- Strong community support
- Aligned with our strategic direction

**Implications**:

- Default choice for new projects
- Actively recommended
- Well-supported by internal resources and documentation

### 2. Trial

**Definition**: Technologies worth pursuing, but not yet fully proven within Bayat.

**Characteristics**:

- Shows clear benefits over existing solutions
- Successfully implemented in at least one project
- Some internal expertise exists
- Reasonable maturity and community support

**Implications**:

- Recommended for non-critical projects or components
- Requires monitoring and evaluation
- Knowledge sharing is expected from teams using these technologies

### 3. Assess

**Definition**: Technologies worth exploring with a low-risk approach.

**Characteristics**:

- Potentially valuable but unproven
- Limited internal experience
- May be emerging or niche
- Requires further evaluation

**Implications**:

- Suitable for proof-of-concepts or isolated components
- Requires explicit justification and risk assessment
- Requires clear learning and evaluation plan

### 4. Hold

**Definition**: Technologies that should be avoided for new projects.

**Characteristics**:

- Legacy technologies being phased out
- Technologies that didn't meet expectations in trials
- Technologies with significant known issues
- Declining industry support or community
- No longer aligned with our strategic direction

**Implications**:

- Not recommended for new projects
- Existing usage should have migration plans
- Requires exception approval for new usage

## Quadrants

The radar is divided into four quadrants:

### 1. Languages & Frameworks

Programming languages, frameworks, and major libraries that form the foundation of our applications.

Examples: JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Angular, .NET Core, Django, Spring Boot, Unity, Unreal Engine

### 2. Tools

Development, testing, and operational tools that support the software development lifecycle.

Examples: Git, Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, GitHub Actions, Jira, Figma, VS Code, JetBrains IDEs

### 3. Platforms & Infrastructure

Environments where we run our software, including cloud providers, databases, and middleware.

Examples: AWS, Azure, GCP, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, Kafka, RabbitMQ, Elasticsearch

### 4. Techniques & Practices

Methods, approaches, and practices that guide how we build software.

Examples: Microservices, Event-driven architecture, DevOps, TDD, BDD, Domain-driven design
