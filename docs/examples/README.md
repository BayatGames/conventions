## Using These Examples

These example repositories are designed to be used as:

1. **Learning Resources**: Study the code to understand how conventions are applied
2. **Project Templates**: Fork and use as a starting point for new projects
3. **Reference Implementations**: Refer to when making architectural decisions

## Contributing Examples

If you'd like to contribute a new example implementation:

1. Follow the [Contribution Guidelines](../../CONTRIBUTING.md)
2. Use the [Project Template](../templates/starter-kits.md) guidelines
3. Ensure your example demonstrates multiple conventions
4. Include thorough documentation and testing

## Requesting New Examples

If you'd like to see an example implementation for a specific technology or pattern:

1. Open an issue with the label "example-request"
2. Describe what you'd like to see demonstrated
3. Explain how it would be useful to the team

## Keeping Examples Updated

Example repositories are reviewed and updated quarterly to ensure they remain aligned with the latest conventions and best practices.
