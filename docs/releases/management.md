# Release Management

This document outlines the standards and best practices for release management across all Bayat projects.

## Versioning Scheme

### Semantic Versioning (SemVer)

All Bayat projects must follow semantic versioning guidelines in the format of `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`:

- **MAJOR**: Incompatible API changes
- **MINOR**: Backwards-compatible functionality additions
- **PATCH**: Backwards-compatible bug fixes

Examples:
- `1.0.0` - Initial stable release
- `1.1.0` - New features added
- `1.1.1` - Bug fixes

### Pre-release Identifiers

For pre-release versions, use the following identifiers:
- `alpha` - Early testing, unstable
- `beta` - Feature complete, potentially unstable
- `rc` - Release candidate, feature frozen

Examples:
- `1.0.0-alpha.1`
- `1.0.0-beta.2`
- `1.0.0-rc.1`

## Release Cycle

### Standard Release Cycle
1. Development phase (feature branches)
2. Integration phase (merge to develop)
3. Stabilization phase (create release branch)
4. Release candidate testing
5. Production release (merge to main/master)
6. Post-release maintenance

### Release Timeframes
- **Major releases**: Every 6-12 months
- **Minor releases**: Every 1-3 months
- **Patch releases**: As needed, typically within 1-2 weeks of bug discovery

## Release Process

### Pre-Release Checklist
- All tests passing on CI/CD pipeline
- Code review completed
- Documentation updated
- Release notes prepared
- Security scan completed
- Performance tests passed
- Accessibility compliance verified
- Localization completed

### Release Notes
Release notes must include:
- Version number and release date
- Summary of changes
- New features (for minor and major releases)
- Bug fixes with reference to issue IDs
- Breaking changes with migration guide
- Dependencies updated
- Deprecation notices
- Contributors acknowledgment

### Release Artifacts
- Source code tags in repository
- Compiled binaries/packages
- Docker images
- Documentation updates
- Deployment manifests

## Deployment Stages

### Environments
- Development
- Testing/QA
- Staging
- Production

### Rollout Strategy
- Canary deployments for high-risk changes
- Blue/green deployments for zero-downtime updates
- Progressive rollout for user-facing changes

## Rollback Procedures

### Rollback Triggers
- Critical security vulnerabilities
- Data corruption issues
- Significant performance degradation
- Feature regression affecting core functionality

### Rollback Process
1. Identify the need for rollback
2. Communicate to stakeholders
3. Deploy previous stable version
4. Verify system stability
5. Analyze failure and document lessons learned

## LTS (Long-Term Support) Policy

- LTS releases are designated for production use
- Supported for a minimum of 12 months
- Security updates provided for entire support period
- No new features added to LTS releases

## Archiving Policy

- End-of-life notification 3 months before support ends
- Archive repository with clear EOL notice
- Provide migration path to supported versions

## Communication

### Stakeholder Notification
- Advance notice for major releases (1 month)
- Release announcement emails
- Change log published on relevant platforms
- Deprecation notices (3 months before removal)

### Release Calendar
- Maintain a public release calendar
- Communicate schedule changes at least 2 weeks in advance
