   - Configure appropriate sampling rates

2. **Custom Instrumentation**:
   - Instrument critical business transactions
   - Use consistent naming conventions for custom metrics
   - Capture relevant contextual information

```javascript
// Example of custom instrumentation in Node.js
const metrics = require('metrics-library');

async function processOrder(order) {
  const timer = metrics.startTimer('order_processing');
  try {
    // Order processing logic
    metrics.increment('orders_processed', 1, {
      type: order.type,
      paymentMethod: order.paymentMethod
    });
    return result;
  } catch (error) {
    metrics.increment('orders_failed', 1, {
      type: order.type,
      error: error.name
    });
    throw error;
  } finally {
    timer.end();
  }
}
```

#### Infrastructure Instrumentation

Guidelines for infrastructure monitoring:

1. **Host-Level Metrics**:
   - Deploy monitoring agents on all hosts
   - Collect system metrics at 15-second intervals

2. **Container Metrics**:
   - Monitor container-specific metrics
   - Track container lifecycle events

3. **Cloud Resource Metrics**:
   - Integrate with cloud provider monitoring
   - Monitor provisioned and utilized resources

### Data Retention
