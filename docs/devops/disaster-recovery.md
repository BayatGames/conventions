# Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity Standards

This document outlines the standards and best practices for ensuring application and system resilience, recovery from disasters, and business continuity at Bayat.

## Foundational Concepts

### Resilience Terminology
- **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**: Maximum acceptable time for service restoration
- **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**: Maximum acceptable data loss period
- **Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR)**: Average time to restore service after failure
- **Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)**: Average operational time between failures
- **Business Impact Analysis (BIA)**: Assessment of failure impact on operations

### System Classification
1. **Criticality Levels**:
   - **Tier 0**: Mission-critical (no downtime tolerated)
   - **Tier 1**: Business-critical (minutes of downtime tolerated)
   - **Tier 2**: Important (hours of downtime tolerated)
   - **Tier 3**: Non-critical (days of downtime tolerated)

2. **Classification Requirements**:
   - Criticality assessment methodology
   - Classification review frequency
   - Documentation requirements for classification decisions
   - Stakeholder approval process
