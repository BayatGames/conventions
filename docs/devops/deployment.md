## Deployment Principles

All deployments at Bayat should adhere to the following core principles:

1. **Automation**: Automate deployment processes to ensure consistency and reduce human error
2. **Repeatability**: Deployment processes should produce the same results when repeated
3. **Traceability**: Track what was deployed, when, by whom, and with what configuration
4. **Security**: Include security checks and validations at each stage
5. **Testability**: Verify deployments against defined acceptance criteria
6. **Isolation**: Changes to one environment should not affect others
7. **Rollback capability**: Every deployment should have a defined rollback plan
8. **Minimal downtime**: Strive for zero-downtime deployments where possible

## Environments

### Standard Environments

Every project must have at least the following environments:

| Environment | Purpose | Access | Deployment Frequency | Data Sensitivity |
|-------------|---------|--------|---------------------|------------------|
| Development | Feature development and integration | Developers | Continuous | Sanitized/Fake |
| Testing/QA | Formal testing and validation | QA, Developers | After dev approval | Sanitized/Fake |
| Staging | Pre-production verification | Limited team members | After QA approval | Production-like sanitized |
| Production | Live customer-facing environment | Highly restricted | Scheduled releases | Real data |

### Environment Parity

Maintain high parity between environments:

- Use the same operating systems, versions, and configurations
- Use the same deployment mechanisms across all environments
- Scale differences should be in resource allocation, not architecture
- Document any necessary differences between environments

## Deployment Process

### Deployment Pipeline

All projects must implement a deployment pipeline with the following stages:

1. **Build**: Compile code, run static analysis, create deployment artifacts
2. **Test**: Run automated tests (unit, integration, etc.)
3. **Scan**: Perform security scanning, dependency vulnerability checks
4. **Publish**: Push artifacts to registries (container, package, etc.)
5. **Deploy**: Release to target environment
6. **Verify**: Run post-deployment checks and smoke tests
7. **Monitor**: Track system health and metrics after deployment

### Approval Gates

Define approval requirements for each environment:

- **Development**: Automated checks only
- **Testing/QA**: Lead developer approval
- **Staging**: QA approval and product owner sign-off
- **Production**: Management approval and change management process

### Required Checks

Every deployment must pass the following checks:

- All automated tests pass
- Security scan shows no critical or high vulnerabilities
- Infrastructure validation tests pass
- Required approvals have been obtained
- Release documentation is complete

## Versioning

### Version Scheme

Use Semantic Versioning (SemVer) for all deployable artifacts:

- **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH** (e.g., 2.3.1)
- Increment MAJOR version for incompatible API changes
- Increment MINOR version for backward-compatible new features
- Increment PATCH version for backward-compatible bug fixes

### Version Tracking

- Tag all releases in the version control system with the version number
- Store the current version information in a dedicated location in each environment
- Include version information in logs and monitoring data
- Make the version visible in the application's admin interface or API

## Artifacts and Registries

### Artifact Types

Standardize on the following artifact types:

- Docker containers for applications
- NPM/PyPI packages for libraries
- Helm charts for Kubernetes deployments
- Terraform modules for infrastructure
- OS-specific packages (RPM, DEB) for system components

### Registry Requirements

All artifact registries must:

- Require authentication for uploads and restricted downloads
- Support artifact signing and verification
- Maintain artifact retention policies
- Be backed up regularly
- Support versioning and immutability

### Standardized Registries

Use the following registries:

- Container images: Harbor or AWS ECR
- NPM packages: GitHub Packages or JFrog Artifactory
- Python packages: JFrog Artifactory
- Helm charts: Harbor or JFrog Artifactory
- Infrastructure modules: GitLab or GitHub

## Configuration Management

### Configuration Sources

Manage configuration using the following hierarchy:

1. **Default values**: Hard-coded in application
2. **Configuration files**: Version-controlled with the application
3. **Environment variables**: For environment-specific settings
4. **Configuration service**: For dynamic runtime configuration

### Secrets Management

Handle sensitive information appropriately:

- Never commit secrets to version control
- Use a dedicated secrets management service (HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)
- Encrypt secrets at rest and in transit
- Rotate secrets regularly
- Use different secrets for each environment

### Configuration Validation

Validate configurations before deployment:

- Verify required configuration is present
- Check types and formats
- Validate connections to external services
- Test with the configuration before promoting to next environment

## Deployment Automation

### CI/CD Tools

Standardize on the following CI/CD tools:

- GitHub Actions or GitLab CI for pipeline orchestration
- Terraform or AWS CloudFormation for infrastructure as code
- Ansible or Puppet for configuration management
- ArgoCD or Flux for GitOps-based deployments

### Pipeline As Code

Store pipeline configurations as code:

- Keep pipeline definitions in the same repository as application code
- Version pipeline changes alongside application changes
- Review pipeline changes through the same process as code changes
- Test pipeline changes in development environments first

### Automated Testing

Include the following tests in deployment pipelines:

- Unit tests
- Integration tests
- End-to-end tests
- Performance tests (for staging/production)
- Security scans
- Infrastructure validation tests

## Deployment Strategies

Choose the appropriate deployment strategy based on application requirements:

### Blue/Green Deployment

For applications requiring minimal downtime with higher resource usage:

1. Deploy new version (green) alongside existing version (blue)
2. Test the green environment
3. Switch traffic from blue to green
4. Verify operation
5. Decommission blue environment

### Canary Deployment

For gradual rollouts with early feedback:

1. Deploy new version to a small subset of infrastructure (e.g., 5%)
2. Route a percentage of traffic to the new version
3. Monitor for issues
4. Gradually increase traffic percentage
5. Proceed to full deployment or rollback based on monitoring

### Rolling Deployment

For resource-efficient deployments:

1. Deploy new version to a subset of instances/pods
2. Verify proper operation
3. Continue deploying to more instances in batches
4. Complete when all instances are updated

### Feature Flags

Use feature flags for controlled feature releases:

1. Deploy code with new features behind disabled flags
2. Enable features selectively for specific users or environments
3. Roll out features gradually by increasing the percentage of users
4. Monitor feature performance and issues
5. Enable for all users or roll back as needed

## Rollback Procedures

### Rollback Triggers

Define clear criteria for initiating a rollback:

- Error rates exceed defined thresholds
- Response times exceed SLA limits
- Critical functionality is unavailable
- Security vulnerability is discovered
- Stakeholder decision based on business impact

### Rollback Process

Document and test rollback procedures for each application:

1. Determine the need for rollback based on triggers
2. Follow application-specific rollback procedure:
   - Revert to previous version
   - Restore database if necessary
   - Reset configuration as needed
3. Verify application functionality after rollback
4. Communicate rollback to stakeholders
5. Document the rollback incident

### Rollback Testing

Regularly test rollback procedures:

- Include rollback tests in deployment pipelines
- Simulate failures and practice recovery
- Time rollback operations to ensure they meet SLA requirements

## Release Notes

### Release Documentation

Create comprehensive release notes for each production deployment:

1. **Summary**: Brief overview of the release
2. **Version**: Clear version identifier
3. **Date**: Deployment date
4. **Features**: New features and enhancements
5. **Bug fixes**: Issues resolved
6. **Known issues**: Outstanding problems
7. **Dependencies**: External system dependencies
8. **Configuration changes**: Any new or modified configuration
9. **Migration steps**: Required actions for users or administrators
10. **Rollback plan**: Specific rollback instructions for this release

### Distribution Channels

Make release notes available through:

- Internal documentation system for all environments
- Customer-facing documentation for production releases
- Email notifications to stakeholders
- Release management system (Jira, Azure DevOps, etc.)

## Post-Deployment Verification

### Smoke Tests

Run automated smoke tests immediately after deployment:

- Verify basic functionality
- Check critical paths and workflows
- Validate integrations with external systems
- Confirm metrics and logging are working

### Acceptance Criteria

Define and verify acceptance criteria for each deployment:

- Functional requirements are met
- Non-functional requirements (performance, security) are satisfied
- No regression in existing functionality
- Documentation is complete and accurate

### Progressive Exposure

For complex applications, use progressive exposure:

1. Deploy to internal users first
2. Expand to beta/early adopters
3. Gradually increase to full user base
4. Monitor each expansion phase

## Environment-Specific Guidelines

### Kubernetes

For Kubernetes deployments:

- Use Helm charts for application packaging
- Implement namespace isolation between environments
- Apply resource quotas and limits
- Use network policies to restrict traffic
- Store Kubernetes manifests in version control
- Follow GitOps practices using ArgoCD or Flux

Example Deployment Configuration:

```yaml
# Helm values.yaml for a standard web application
replicaCount: 3

image:
  repository: bayat/myapp
  tag: 1.2.3
  pullPolicy: IfNotPresent

resources:
  limits:
    cpu: 500m
    memory: 512Mi
  requests:
    cpu: 200m
    memory: 256Mi

autoscaling:
  enabled: true
  minReplicas: 2
  maxReplicas: 10
  targetCPUUtilizationPercentage: 80

ingress:
  enabled: true
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx
    cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: letsencrypt-prod
  hosts:
    - host: myapp.bayat.io
      paths:
        - path: /
          pathType: Prefix

securityContext:
  runAsUser: 1000
  runAsGroup: 3000
  fsGroup: 2000
  readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
```

### Serverless

For serverless deployments:

- Use infrastructure as code (AWS SAM, Serverless Framework)
- Implement separate AWS accounts for each environment
- Set appropriate resource limits and concurrency controls
- Use API Gateway for routing and authorization
- Configure monitoring and alerting
- Version Lambda functions and API configurations

Example Serverless Configuration:

```yaml
# serverless.yml for a typical serverless application
service: bayat-service

provider:
  name: aws
  runtime: nodejs14.x
  region: us-west-2
  stage: ${opt:stage, 'dev'}
  environment:
    STAGE: ${self:provider.stage}
    LOG_LEVEL: ${self:custom.logLevels.${self:provider.stage}}
  iamRoleStatements:
    - Effect: Allow
      Action:
        - dynamodb:Query
        - dynamodb:GetItem
      Resource: !GetAtt MyTable.Arn

custom:
  logLevels:
    dev: DEBUG
    test: INFO
    staging: INFO
    prod: WARN

functions:
  api:
    handler: src/handlers/api.handler
    events:
      - http:
          path: /users
          method: get
          authorizer:
            type: COGNITO_USER_POOLS
            authorizerId: !Ref ApiGatewayAuthorizer
      - http:
          path: /users/{id}
          method: get

resources:
  Resources:
    MyTable:
      Type: AWS::DynamoDB::Table
      Properties:
        BillingMode: PAY_PER_REQUEST
        KeySchema:
          - AttributeName: id
            KeyType: HASH
        AttributeDefinitions:
          - AttributeName: id
            AttributeType: S
```

### Traditional Hosting

For traditional VM/server deployments:

- Use infrastructure as code (Terraform, CloudFormation)
- Implement configuration management (Ansible, Puppet)
- Create standard machine images (AMIs, Vagrant boxes)
- Apply host-based security measures
- Set up proper backup and recovery procedures
- Document manual recovery steps

Example Terraform Configuration:

```hcl
# main.tf for a typical web server
provider "aws" {
  region = var.region
}

module "vpc" {
  source = "./modules/vpc"
  environment = var.environment
}

module "security_groups" {
  source = "./modules/security_groups"
  vpc_id = module.vpc.vpc_id
  environment = var.environment
}

resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  count = var.instance_count

  ami           = var.ami_id
  instance_type = var.instance_type
  subnet_id     = module.vpc.public_subnets[count.index % length(module.vpc.public_subnets)]
  vpc_security_group_ids = [module.security_groups.web_sg_id]
  key_name      = var.key_name

  tags = {
    Name        = "web-${var.environment}-${count.index}"
    Environment = var.environment
    Project     = var.project_name
    ManagedBy   = "terraform"
  }

  root_block_device {
    volume_size = 50
    volume_type = "gp2"
    encrypted   = true
  }

  lifecycle {
    create_before_destroy = true
  }
}

resource "aws_elb" "web" {
  name = "web-${var.environment}-elb"
  subnets = module.vpc.public_subnets
  security_groups = [module.security_groups.elb_sg_id]

  listener {
    instance_port     = 80
    instance_protocol = "http"
    lb_port           = 443
    lb_protocol       = "https"
    ssl_certificate_id = var.ssl_cert_arn
  }

  health_check {
    healthy_threshold   = 2
    unhealthy_threshold = 2
    timeout             = 3
    target              = "HTTP:80/health"
    interval            = 30
  }

  instances = aws_instance.web[*].id
  cross_zone_load_balancing = true
  idle_timeout = 400

  tags = {
    Name        = "web-${var.environment}-elb"
    Environment = var.environment
    Project     = var.project_name
    ManagedBy   = "terraform"
  }
}
```

## Security Considerations

### Pre-Deployment Security

Verify security before deployment:

- Run SAST (Static Application Security Testing)
- Perform dependency vulnerability scanning
- Review infrastructure configurations for security issues
- Validate IAM/RBAC configurations
- Check for secrets in code

### Runtime Security

Implement runtime security measures:

- Deploy web application firewalls (WAF)
- Enable runtime application security protection (RASP)
- Configure network security groups and access controls
- Implement API rate limiting
- Enable audit logging

### Compliance Verification

For regulated environments:

- Document compliance requirements
- Include compliance checks in deployment pipelines
- Generate compliance artifacts for auditing
- Require security sign-off for production deployments

## Maintenance Windows

### Scheduled Maintenance

Define standard maintenance windows:

- **Production**: Weekly, during lowest traffic periods (e.g., Sundays 2-5 AM)
- **Staging**: Bi-weekly, during business hours with notification
- **Testing/QA**: As needed with team coordination
- **Development**: No formal window required

### Maintenance Procedures

For each maintenance window:

1. Announce maintenance period to stakeholders
2. Prepare rollback plans
3. Execute planned changes
4. Verify functionality after changes
5. Communicate completion of maintenance
6. Document actions taken

### Emergency Maintenance

For unscheduled urgent changes:

1. Assess impact and urgency
2. Obtain expedited approvals
3. Communicate to critical stakeholders
4. Implement changes with heightened monitoring
5. Document incident and follow-up actions

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Deployment Monitoring

Monitor deployments in progress:

- Track deployment progress and status
- Monitor system health during deployment
- Compare performance metrics before and after deployment
- Set up alerting for deployment failures

### Post-Deployment Monitoring

After deployment, monitor:

- Error rates and exceptions
- Response times and latency
- Resource utilization (CPU, memory, disk)
- Business metrics (transactions, user activity)
- Security events

### Alerting Guidelines

Configure appropriate alerting:

- Define clear thresholds based on SLAs and normal behavior
- Set different alerting levels (info, warning, critical)
- Assign alerts to the right teams
- Implement alert aggregation to prevent alert fatigue
- Document response procedures for each alert type
