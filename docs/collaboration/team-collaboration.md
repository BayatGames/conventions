# Team Collaboration Standards

This document outlines the standards and best practices for team collaboration across all Bayat projects.

## Communication Channels

### Channel Selection Guidelines

| Communication Type | Preferred Channel | When to Use |
|-------------------|------------------|-------------|
| Quick questions | Slack/Teams | For immediate, non-critical questions |
| Project discussions | Project management tool | For discussions related to specific tasks or issues |
| Technical decisions | Pull requests/Code reviews | For code-related discussions and decisions |
| Design feedback | Design review tools | For providing feedback on design artifacts |
| Urgent matters | Direct call/Meeting | For critical issues requiring immediate attention |
| Knowledge sharing | Wiki/Documentation | For sharing information that should be preserved |
| Status updates | Daily standup/Project management tool | For regular progress updates |

### Communication Etiquette

- Respect team members' focus time
- Set clear expectations for response times
- Use asynchronous communication when possible
- Be clear and concise in all communications
- Include all relevant information in initial messages
- Use appropriate formatting for better readability
- Always provide context for questions or discussions

## Issue Tracking

### Issue Management Workflow

1. **Backlog**: Issue is identified and added to the backlog
2. **Triage**: Issue is reviewed, prioritized, and assigned to a milestone
3. **Ready for Development**: Issue is fully specified and ready to be worked on
4. **In Progress**: Work has begun on the issue
5. **In Review**: Work is completed and ready for review
6. **Done**: Issue is resolved and closed

### Issue Creation Standards

Every issue must include:
- Clear, concise title that summarizes the issue
- Detailed description with steps to reproduce (for bugs)
- Expected outcome or acceptance criteria
- Priority and severity labels
- Related components or modules
- Relevant attachments (screenshots, logs, etc.)
- Links to related issues or dependencies

### Issue Templates

- Bug Report Template
- Feature Request Template
- Technical Debt Template
- Documentation Request Template

## Agile Methodology

### Scrum Practices

- Sprint length: 2 weeks
- Sprint Planning: Beginning of each sprint
- Daily Standup: 15 minutes, same time each day
- Sprint Review: End of each sprint
- Sprint Retrospective: After each sprint review
- Backlog Refinement: Weekly, mid-sprint

### Kanban Practices

- Limit Work in Progress (WIP) to 2 items per developer
- Pull system for new work
- Regular process reviews
- Explicit process policies
- Visual management board

### Story Points and Estimation

- Use Fibonacci sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21)
- Estimate as a team during planning/refinement
- Base estimates on complexity, not time
- Track velocity over time
- Re-estimate stories that change significantly

## Meeting Standards

### Meeting Types and Cadence

| Meeting Type | Duration | Frequency | Participants |
|--------------|----------|-----------|-------------|
| Daily Standup | 15 min | Daily | Development Team |
| Sprint Planning | 2-4 hrs | Bi-weekly | All team members |
| Sprint Review | 1-2 hrs | Bi-weekly | All team members, stakeholders |
| Retrospective | 1-2 hrs | Bi-weekly | All team members |
| Backlog Refinement | 1 hr | Weekly | Product Owner, Team Lead, Selected Developers |
| Design Review | 1 hr | As needed | Designers, Developers, Product Owner |
| Technical Discussion | 1 hr | As needed | Relevant technical team members |

### Meeting Guidelines

- Always have a clear agenda
- Start and end on time
- Document decisions and action items
- Designate a facilitator for each meeting
- Send meeting invites with sufficient notice
- Include relevant materials with invites
- Follow up with meeting notes

## Documentation

### Documentation Types

- README files for repositories
- Project wikis for knowledge bases
- API documentation
- Technical design documents
- User guides
- Onboarding documentation
- Meeting notes and decisions

### Documentation Standards

- Use Markdown for all documentation
- Follow consistent formatting
- Include timestamps and author information
- Version control all documentation
- Regular reviews and updates
- Clear naming conventions
- Appropriate level of detail

## Code Reviews

### Code Review Process

1. Developer creates a pull request
2. Automated checks run (CI/CD, linting, tests)
3. At least one team member reviews the code
4. Feedback is provided and addressed
5. Additional review if significant changes are made
6. Approval and merge once requirements are met

### Code Review Guidelines

- Review for design and architectural concerns
- Check for adherence to coding standards
- Verify test coverage
- Look for security vulnerabilities
- Ensure documentation is updated
- Provide constructive feedback
- Respond to reviews promptly

## Knowledge Sharing

### Knowledge Sharing Activities

- Weekly tech talks (30 minutes)
- Monthly deep dives (1-2 hours)
- Pair/mob programming sessions
- Documentation days (quarterly)
- Internal blog posts
- Shared reading lists
- Conference attendance and reporting back

### Onboarding Process

- Assigned mentor for new team members
- Structured first-week plan
- Documentation of common tasks and processes
- Regular check-ins during first month
- Gradual increase in responsibility
- Early involvement in code reviews
