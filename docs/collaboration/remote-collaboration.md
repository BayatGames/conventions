## Collaboration Principles

### Core Principles

1. **Transparency First**: Make work visible and decisions transparent
2. **Asynchronous by Default**: Design workflows that don't require real-time interaction
3. **Documentation Over Tribal Knowledge**: Document everything important
4. **Inclusive Communication**: Accommodate different time zones, languages, and work styles
5. **Outcome Over Activity**: Focus on results rather than hours worked
6. **Deliberate Overcommunication**: Err on the side of sharing more information
7. **Trust and Autonomy**: Trust team members to manage their work effectively

### Team Agreements

Each remote or distributed team should establish:

- Core collaboration hours for synchronous activities
- Response time expectations for different communication channels
- Status update frequency and format
- Availability indicators and their meanings
- Process for urgent issues outside of working hours
- Decision-making frameworks for various scenarios

## Communication Standards

### Channel Selection

Choose the appropriate communication channel based on:

| Communication Need | Preferred Channels | Considerations |
|-------------------|-------------------|---------------|
| Quick questions | Chat, team channel | Consider making public for team visibility |
| Complex discussions | Video calls, document comments | Ensure discussions are documented |
| Status updates | Project management tool, async updates | Should be regular and consistent |
| Knowledge sharing | Documentation, recorded presentations | Must be accessible to future team members |
| Sensitive feedback | Private video calls, 1-on-1s | Follow up with written summary |
| Urgent issues | Defined escalation protocol | Clear SLAs for response time |

### Written Communication Best Practices

- **Be Clear and Concise**:
  - Use clear subject lines that reflect content
  - Lead with the most important information
  - Use bullet points for clarity
  - Highlight actions and decisions

- **Provide Context**:
  - Include relevant background information
  - Link to related resources and previous discussions
  - Explain the "why" behind requests

- **Set Clear Expectations**:
  - Explicitly state deadlines
  - Clarify if you need a response
  - Indicate the level of priority

### Status and Availability

- Use standardized status indicators across tools:
  - **Available**: Open for collaboration
  - **Focused**: Working but prefer not to be interrupted
  - **In Meeting**: Currently in a scheduled meeting
  - **Away**: Temporarily unavailable
  - **Offline**: Not working

- Communicate schedule changes:
  - Update shared calendars with working hours
  - Notify team of extended absences
  - Set expectations for off-hours availability

## Remote Meetings

### Meeting Types and Cadence

| Meeting Type | Recommended Frequency | Maximum Duration | Required Artifacts |
|--------------|---------------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Team standup | Daily | 15 minutes | Action items |
| Sprint planning | Biweekly | 90 minutes | Sprint backlog |
| Backlog refinement | Weekly | 60 minutes | Updated backlog |
| Sprint review | Biweekly | 60 minutes | Demo recording |
| Retrospective | Biweekly | 60 minutes | Action plan |
| 1:1 check-ins | Weekly | 30 minutes | Notes/action items |
| All-hands | Monthly | 60 minutes | Recording, slides |
| Design reviews | As needed | 60 minutes | Design documents |
| Technical discussions | As needed | 90 minutes | Technical specification |

### Meeting Preparation Standards

- **Before the Meeting**:
  - Distribute agenda at least 24 hours in advance
  - Include pre-reading materials with sufficient time to review
  - Clearly state meeting objectives and expected outcomes
  - Assign roles: facilitator, note-taker, timekeeper

- **Scheduling Considerations**:
  - Respect team members' time zones (use tools like World Time Buddy)
  - Schedule within core collaboration hours when possible
  - Batch meetings to preserve focus time
  - Provide recording options for those who cannot attend

### Meeting Facilitation Guidelines

- Start on time and end on time or early
- Begin with clear objectives and agenda review
- Use a shared document for collaborative note-taking
- Ensure equitable participation (round-robin, nominal voting, etc.)
- Document decisions, action items, and owners
- Conclude with a summary and next steps

### Effective Participation

- Join with video on when bandwidth permits
- Mute when not speaking
- Use hand-raise features for orderly discussion
- Minimize multitasking during meetings
- Use chat for questions without interrupting
- Provide feedback in the manner requested

## Asynchronous Work

### Async-First Workflows

- **Default to Asynchronous**:
  - Ask: "Does this require a meeting or can it be handled asynchronously?"
  - Design workflows to minimize dependencies on real-time collaboration
  - Use meetings for relationship building, complex problem-solving, and sensitive discussions

- **Decision-Making Processes**:
  - Document proposals in shared documents
  - Set timeframes for feedback and decisions
  - Use structured formats: RFC (Request for Comments), ADR (Architecture Decision Records)
  - Record decisions and rationale in accessible locations

### Structured Updates

- **Personal Updates**:
  - Daily work logs in team channel or tool
  - Format: What I completed, what I'm working on, blockers
  - Timing: Beginning or end of workday

- **Project Updates**:
  - Weekly summaries of progress, challenges, and priorities
  - Use standardized templates
  - Include metrics and progress indicators
  - Highlight risks and dependencies

### Creating Async-Friendly Content

- **Written Communication**:
  - Use clear headings and structured formats
  - Include executive summaries for longer documents
  - Use visual elements to improve understanding
  - Consider the audience's context and background

- **Video Content**:
  - Keep recordings under 15 minutes when possible
  - Include timestamps for key sections
  - Provide searchable transcripts
  - Summarize key points in writing

## Documentation

### Documentation Standards

Documentation should be:

- **Discoverable**: Easy to find using search and navigation
- **Current**: Regularly updated and versioned
- **Comprehensive**: Cover what's needed for understanding
- **Consistent**: Follow standard formats and templates
- **Accessible**: Available to all who need it

### Required Documentation

| Documentation Type | Purpose | Ownership | Update Frequency |
|-------------------|---------|-----------|------------------|
| Team handbook | Team practices, workflows, contacts | Team lead | Monthly |
| Project overview | Project goals, scope, timeline, stakeholders | Project manager | When scope changes |
| Technical specs | System design, architecture decisions | Tech lead | When architecture changes |
| API documentation | Interface definitions, examples | Development team | When API changes |
| Testing strategy | Test approach, coverage goals | QA lead | Per release cycle |
| Onboarding guide | New team member instructions | Team lead | Quarterly |
| Decision log | Record of key decisions and context | Decision owner | When decisions are made |
| Meeting notes | Record of discussions and outcomes | Meeting facilitator | After each meeting |

### Documentation Process

### Inclusive Practices

- **Language Considerations**:
  - Use simple, clear language
  - Minimize idioms and cultural references
