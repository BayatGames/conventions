## Introduction

A design system is a collection of reusable components, guided by clear standards, that can be assembled to build any number of applications. This document provides guidelines for creating and maintaining effective design systems that enhance consistency, efficiency, and quality across all Bayat projects.

## Design System Principles

Our design systems are built on the following core principles:

1. **Consistency** - Provide a unified user experience across all products
2. **Scalability** - Support growth from small projects to enterprise applications
3. **Accessibility** - Ensure usability for all users, regardless of abilities
4. **Efficiency** - Accelerate development through reusable components
5. **Flexibility** - Allow for customization while maintaining core standards
6. **Maintainability** - Support ongoing evolution with clear governance

## Components and Organization

### Component Hierarchy

Design systems should follow a clear atomic design methodology:

1. **Atoms** - Basic building blocks (buttons, inputs, icons)
2. **Molecules** - Simple groups of UI elements functioning together
3. **Organisms** - Complex UI components composed of molecules and atoms
4. **Templates** - Page-level objects that place components into a layout
5. **Pages** - Specific instances of templates with real content

### Component Structure

Each component must include:

- **Properties** - All configurable options
- **States** - Visual representations of different states (hover, focus, disabled)
- **Variants** - Alternative versions of the component
- **Responsive behavior** - How the component adapts across different screen sizes
- **Code examples** - Implementation examples in relevant frameworks

### Component Inclusion Criteria

When determining whether to add a new component to the design system, evaluate against these criteria:

1. **Usage Frequency** - Components should be needed across multiple products or features
2. **Complexity** - Components should solve non-trivial UI problems
3. **Consistency Requirements** - Elements where consistency is particularly important
4. **Maintenance Efficiency** - Components where centralized maintenance provides clear benefits
5. **Accessibility Requirements** - Elements with specific accessibility considerations

### Component Creation Process

1. **Identify Need** - Document specific use cases and requirements
2. **Research** - Review existing solutions both internally and externally
3. **Design** - Create initial designs with all states and variants
4. **Prototype** - Build functional prototype to validate the approach
5. **Review** - Conduct design, engineering, and accessibility reviews
6. **Implement** - Develop the production component
7. **Document** - Create comprehensive documentation
8. **Release** - Version, publish, and announce the component
9. **Maintain** - Gather feedback and iterate

## Visual Design Standards

### Typography

- Define a clear typographic scale with appropriate sizes for different contexts
- Specify font families for headings, body text, and code
- Document line height, letter spacing, and font weight standards
- Include guidelines for responsive typography

### Color System

- Establish a primary, secondary, and accent color palette
- Define semantic colors (success, warning, error, info)
- Include accessibility guidelines for color contrast
- Provide dark mode color alternatives
- Document color usage rules and combinations

### Spacing

- Define a consistent spacing scale
- Document spacing between components, sections, and page elements
- Provide responsive spacing guidelines

### Iconography

- Establish icon style guidelines (filled, outlined, etc.)
- Define size, color, and usage standards
- Provide a process for creating or requesting new icons

### Imagery and Illustrations

- Define style guidelines for photos, illustrations, and diagrams
- Provide image size and quality standards
- Document image accessibility requirements (alt text, etc.)

## Design Tokens

Design tokens are the visual design atoms of the design system - specifically, they are named entities that store visual design attributes.

### Token Organization

- **Global tokens** - Raw values like color palette, typography scale
- **Alias tokens** - Functional mappings like primary-color, danger-color
- **Component tokens** - Component-specific tokens

### Token Implementation

- Document the technical implementation of tokens (CSS variables, JSON, etc.)
- Provide guidelines for consuming tokens in different platforms
- Define synchronization strategy between design tools and code

## Accessibility in Design

All design system components must meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards at minimum:

- Ensure sufficient color contrast (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)
- Support keyboard navigation and focus states
- Include proper ARIA attributes in component implementations
- Document accessibility features and usage for each component
- Include screen reader behavior documentation

## Documentation Standards

### Component Documentation

Each component should be documented with:

- Purpose and usage guidelines
- Visual examples of all states and variants
- Implementation code
- Props/API documentation
- Accessibility considerations
- Related components and patterns
- Version history

### Style Guide

Maintain a comprehensive style guide that documents:

- Brand voice and tone
- Writing style and conventions
- UI patterns and interactions
- Platform-specific guidelines

## Versioning and Releases

- Follow semantic versioning for the design system

- Flutter

### Performance Considerations

- Set performance budgets for components
- Document loading strategies
- Provide optimization guidelines

### Cross-Platform Considerations

When implementing across platforms, consider:

- **Platform Idioms** - Balance consistency with platform-native behavior
- **Capability Differences** - Account for varying capabilities across platforms
- **Performance Profiles** - Adjust implementation based on platform performance characteristics
- **Input Methods** - Adapt to touch, pointer, keyboard, and other input methods
- **Screen Variability** - Consider the range of screen sizes and densities

### Theming and Customization

Implement a systematic approach to theming that allows for:

- **Brand Variations** - Supporting multiple brands with minimal code changes
- **White Labeling** - Enabling reskinning for partner applications
- **Dark Mode** - Comprehensive support for light and dark themes
- **Localization Needs** - Accommodating text direction and cultural requirements
- **Custom Instances** - Allowing controlled customization while maintaining consistency
