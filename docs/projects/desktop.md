## Overview

Desktop applications provide native-like experiences on Windows, macOS, and Linux platforms. These standards ensure consistency, quality, and maintainability across desktop application projects.

### Guiding Principles

1. **Cross-platform compatibility** where business requirements allow
2. **Native look and feel** appropriate to each platform
3. **Performance optimization** for responsive user experience
4. **Security-first approach** to protect user data
5. **Offline-first design** with sync capabilities when online

## Framework Selection

Choose the appropriate framework based on project requirements:

| Framework | Use Case | Considerations |
|-----------|----------|----------------|
| **Electron.js** | Complex web-based applications | Larger bundle size, more memory usage, but extensive capabilities |
| **Tauri** | Performance-sensitive applications | Smaller bundle size, better performance, Rust learning curve |
| **Qt/QML** | Applications requiring extensive native integration | Lower-level, more complex but powerful |
| **.NET MAUI** | Microsoft-ecosystem applications | Best for Windows, viable on macOS, limited on Linux |
| **JavaFX** | Enterprise applications in Java ecosystem | Cross-platform but heavyweight |

### Decision Matrix

Choose the appropriate framework based on these criteria:

1. **Team Expertise**: Choose technologies your team already knows when possible
2. **Application Complexity**: More complex = Electron or Qt
3. **Performance Requirements**: High performance = Tauri or Qt
4. **Bundle Size Constraints**: Size-sensitive = Tauri
5. **Platform Specificity**: Windows-only = .NET MAUI, Cross-platform = Electron/Tauri

## Architecture

### Recommended Architecture Patterns

1. **Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)**: Preferred pattern for most desktop applications
   - Clean separation of UI from business logic
   - Facilitates testability
   - Well-supported in most frameworks

2. **Model-View-Presenter (MVP)**: Alternative pattern for simpler applications
   - More direct than MVVM in some cases
   - Good for applications with less complex state management

3. **Clean Architecture**: For complex enterprise applications
   - Separation of concerns with distinct layers
   - Domain-driven design principles
   - Independent of frameworks

### State Management

- Use appropriate state management for your framework:
  - **Electron/React**: Redux, MobX, or Zustand
  - **Electron/Vue**: Pinia or Vuex
  - **Tauri/React**: Same as Electron/React
  - **Qt**: Property bindings and signals
  - **.NET MAUI**: MVVM with ObservableCollection or community packages

```

## Cross-Platform Considerations

### Platform Consistency

- Follow platform-specific UI guidelines:
  - [Windows Design Guidelines](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/design/)
  - [macOS Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/macos/)
  - [GNOME Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.gnome.org/hig/) (Linux)

### OS Integration

- Implement appropriate OS integrations for each platform:
  - File type associations
  - System tray/menu bar integration
  - Native notifications
  - Keyboard shortcuts following platform conventions

### Platform-Specific Features

- Implement platform detection and conditional features
- Gracefully degrade when platform-specific features aren't available
- Document platform-specific behaviors and limitations

## User Interface

### UI/UX Standards

- Use a consistent component library appropriate for your framework
- Follow Bayat UI design system (with platform-appropriate adaptations)
- Implement support for both light and dark themes
- Support system theme detection and synchronization

### Accessibility

- Ensure keyboard navigation works properly
- Implement proper ARIA attributes for screen readers
- Support color contrast requirements (WCAG AA minimum)
- Test with screen readers and accessibility tools

### Responsive Design

- Handle window resizing gracefully
- Support various screen resolutions and densities
- Implement minimum window size constraints where appropriate
- Use responsive layouts where possible

## Performance

### Performance Targets

- Application startup: < 2 seconds
- UI response time: < 100ms
- Animation frame rate: 60fps
- Memory usage: Appropriate for target hardware

### Optimization Strategies

- Implement lazy loading for application modules
- Use virtualization for large lists/tables
- Optimize resource usage (images, fonts, etc.)
- Profile and address CPU/memory hotspots

## Security

### Security Requirements

- Implement principle of least privilege
- Secure storage of sensitive data
- Secure communication with remote services
- Input validation and sanitization
- Protection against common desktop application vulnerabilities

### Framework-Specific Security

- **Electron**: Follow the [Electron Security Checklist](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/security)
- **Tauri**: Use the allowlist system to restrict capabilities
- **.NET MAUI**: Follow the [.NET Security Guidelines](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/security/)

## Packaging and Distribution

### Build Automation

- Implement CI/CD pipelines for build and deployment
- Automate versioning according to \1\2)
- Generate platform-specific installers

### Installers

- **Windows**: NSIS or MSIX
- **macOS**: DMG, PKG, or App Store
- **Linux**: AppImage, Flatpak, Snap, or distribution-specific packages

### Code Signing

- Sign all applications with appropriate certificates
- Follow platform-specific signing requirements:
  - Windows: Microsoft Authenticode
  - macOS: Apple Developer Certificate + Notarization
  - Linux: Consider Flatpak signing

## Updates and Maintenance

### Auto-Updates

- Implement secure auto-update system
- Allow user configuration of update behavior
- Support delta updates where possible

### Crash Reporting and Analytics

- Implement crash reporting with user consent
- Collect anonymous usage metrics (with opt-in/opt-out)
- Provide user feedback mechanisms

## Testing

### Test Coverage Requirements

- Unit tests: Minimum 70% coverage
- Integration tests: Core user journeys
- E2E tests: Critical workflows

### Testing Tools

Choose appropriate testing tools based on framework:

- **Electron**:
  - Unit: Jest/Vitest
  - E2E: Playwright or Spectron

- **Tauri**:
  - Frontend: Same as Electron
  - Rust: Rust test framework

- **.NET MAUI**:
  - Unit: xUnit or NUnit
  - UI: Appium or .NET MAUI UI Testing

### Performance Testing

- Implement performance tests for critical operations
- Monitor startup time, memory usage, and CPU consumption
- Benchmark against previous versions and competitors

## Compliance

### Regulatory Requirements

- Implement required accessibility support (Section 508, WCAG)
- Address privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)
- Document compliance status in project documentation
