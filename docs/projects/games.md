## Project Types

Bayat game projects generally fall into the following categories:

### Unity Projects

- **Mobile Games**: Optimized for touch input, battery life, and varying device capabilities
- **PC/Console Games**: Higher-fidelity experiences with more complex gameplay systems
- **VR/AR Games**: Immersive experiences with specialized interaction models
- **Cross-Platform Games**: Games that target multiple platforms with a single codebase

### Unreal Engine Projects

- **High-Fidelity Games**: Visually advanced games that leverage Unreal's rendering capabilities
- **Console/PC Titles**: Performance-intensive games for powerful hardware
- **Multiplayer Experiences**: Games that utilize Unreal's networking framework
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Non-game applications using Unreal's rendering capabilities

## Game Architecture

### Core Architecture Principles

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear separation between systems (e.g., input, rendering, game logic)
2. **Data-Driven Design**: Configuration over code when appropriate
3. **Modularity**: Self-contained systems that communicate through well-defined interfaces
4. **Testability**: Architecture that supports automated testing
5. **Scalability**: Ability to add features without major refactoring

## Common Design Patterns

Implement these patterns consistently across projects:

### Unity Patterns

1. **Scriptable Object Architecture**
   - Use ScriptableObjects for configuration data
   - Implement ScriptableObject-based events for decoupling
   - Create runtime sets for dynamic object collections

2. **Component-Based Design**
   - Favor composition over inheritance
   - Create small, focused components
   - Use interfaces to define component capabilities

3. **Service Locator/Dependency Injection**
   - Implement service locator for global systems
   - Consider Zenject/Extenject for dependency injection
   - Document service dependencies clearly

4. **State Pattern**
   - Use for complex state management (character controllers, game states)
   - Implement clean state transitions
   - Consider hierarchical state machines for complex behavior

5. **Command Pattern**
   - Use for input handling and action execution
   - Implement command queueing when appropriate
   - Enable undo/redo functionality where applicable

### Unreal Patterns

1. **Game Framework Architecture**
   - Follow Unreal's GameMode/GameState pattern
   - Use PlayerController/Pawn separation appropriately
   - Implement custom GameInstance for cross-level persistence

2. **Gameplay Ability System**
   - Use for complex character abilities
   - Implement gameplay tags for flexible attribute system
   - Design modular ability components

3. **Blueprint/C++ Hybrid Approach**
   - Implement core systems in C++
   - Expose configuration to Blueprints
   - Document Blueprint interface points clearly

4. **Event-Driven Communication**
   - Use delegates for event handling
   - Implement event dispatchers for one-to-many communication
   - Document event flows
