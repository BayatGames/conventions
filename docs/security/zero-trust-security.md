# Zero Trust Security Implementation

## Introduction

Zero Trust is a security framework that requires all users and systems, whether inside or outside the organization's network, to be authenticated, authorized, and continuously validated before granting access to applications and data. This document outlines standards and best practices for implementing Zero Trust security across Bayat projects.

## Core Principles

### "Never Trust, Always Verify"

- Verify explicitly - authenticate and authorize based on all available data points
- Use least privilege access - limit user access with just-in-time and just-enough approaches
- Assume breach - minimize blast radius and segment access while verifying end-to-end encryption
- Apply controls consistently across all environments, not just at the perimeter
- Enforce continuous authentication and authorization for all resource access

## Zero Trust Architecture Components

### Identity and Access Management

- Implement strong identity foundation with multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- Apply contextual and risk-based access policies
- Eliminate standing privileges and implement just-in-time access
- Centralize identity management and authentication
- Implement identity governance and lifecycle management

### Device Security

- Ensure device health and compliance before granting access
- Implement device attestation and posture checking
- Apply device-based conditional access policies
- Use mobile device management (MDM) for corporate devices
- Enforce encryption and security baselines

### Network Security

- Segment networks based on sensitivity and functionality
- Implement micro-segmentation to limit east-west movement
- Apply network access controls at granular level
- Move security services closer to assets (security fabric)
- Monitor and log all network traffic

### Application Security

- Secure all applications regardless of hosting location
- Implement application-level authentication and authorization
- Use secured APIs for application integration
- Apply runtime application self-protection (RASP)
- Conduct regular application security testing

### Data Security

- Classify data based on sensitivity and business impact
- Apply encryption for data at rest and in transit
- Implement data loss prevention (DLP) controls
- Apply data access governance
- Maintain data access logs and audit trails

### Visibility and Analytics

- Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring
