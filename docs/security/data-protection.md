## Data Classification

All data must be classified according to these categories:

### Classification Levels

- **Public**: Information that can be freely disclosed to the public (e.g., marketing materials, public APIs)
- **Internal**: Non-sensitive information for use within Bayat (e.g., internal documentation, non-sensitive emails)
- **Confidential**: Business-sensitive information requiring protection (e.g., business plans, product strategy)
- **Restricted**: Highly sensitive information with strict access controls (e.g., financial data, user credentials)
- **Regulated**: Information subject to regulatory requirements (e.g., personal data, payment information)

### Classification Process
