## Introduction

DevSecOps extends DevOps principles by integrating security practices throughout the entire software development lifecycle. This approach ensures that security is not an afterthought but a fundamental aspect of our development process.

### Core Principles

- **Shift Left Security**: Integrate security early in the development process
- **Automation**: Automate security checks and controls wherever possible
- **Continuous Security**: Implement security as a continuous process
- **Shared Responsibility**: Security is everyone's responsibility
- **Rapid Response**: Quickly address security issues when identified

## Security as Code

Security as Code involves managing security controls, policies, and infrastructure through code, enabling version control, testing, and automation.

### Infrastructure as Code Security

- Use security-focused linting tools for IaC (e.g., tfsec for Terraform, cfn-nag for CloudFormation)
- Implement least privilege principles in infrastructure definitions
- Version control all infrastructure code
- Conduct peer reviews of infrastructure changes
- Scan IaC templates for security misconfigurations

### Policy as Code

- Define security policies as code (e.g., using OPA, AWS Config Rules)
- Implement automated policy enforcement
- Version control policy definitions
- Test policies before deployment
- Document policy exceptions with justifications

### Security Pipeline Integration

- Integrate security checks into CI/CD pipelines
- Fail builds for critical security issues
- Generate security reports as pipeline artifacts
- Implement security gates at key stages of the pipeline
- Track security metrics across pipeline runs

## Secure Development Lifecycle
