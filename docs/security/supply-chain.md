# Software Supply Chain Security

This document outlines the standards and best practices for securing the software supply chain at Bayat.

## Supply Chain Security Fundamentals

### Risk Landscape
- **Modern Supply Chain Threats**: Common attack vectors and vulnerabilities
- **Attack Surface Analysis**: Scope and impact of supply chain vulnerabilities
- **Threat Actors**: Motivation and capabilities of potential attackers
- **Regulatory Requirements**: Compliance standards for supply chain security

### Security Principles
1. **Defense in Depth**:
   - Layered security controls
   - Redundant verification mechanisms
   - Principle of least privilege implementation
   - Fail-secure design patterns

2. **Zero Trust**:
   - Trust verification requirements
   - Continuous validation principles
   - Default deny posture
   - Micro-segmentation strategies

## Dependency Management

### Dependency Evaluation
1. **Risk Assessment Framework**:
   - Criticality evaluation criteria
   - Maintainer reputation assessment
   - Security posture evaluation
   - License compliance review

2. **Selection Criteria**:
   - Health metrics evaluation
   - Maintenance activity requirements
   - Community support assessment
   - Commercial support consideration

### Dependency Tracking
1. **Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)**:
   - SBOM generation requirements
   - Format standards (CycloneDX, SPDX)
   - Scope and depth requirements
   - Maintenance and update frequency

2. **Inventory Management**:
   - Dependency database requirements
   - Version tracking systems
   - License management
   - Usage tracking mechanisms

### Vulnerability Management
1. **Monitoring Requirements**:
   - Vulnerability notification systems
   - Automated scanning frequency
