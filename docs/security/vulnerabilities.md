## Vulnerability Assessment

### Risk Rating Methodology

- **Standardized Scoring**:
  - Primary: Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  - Supplementary: Risk-adjusted scoring considering business context
  
- **Rating Factors**:
  - Exploitability: Ease of exploitation
  - Impact: Potential harm if exploited
  - Affected Assets: Criticality of affected systems
  - Exposure: Internal vs. external facing
  - Compensating Controls: Existing mitigating measures

- **Risk Levels**:
  - Critical: CVSS 9.0-10.0 or high business impact
  - High: CVSS 7.0-8.9 or significant business impact
  - Medium: CVSS 4.0-6.9 or moderate business impact
  - Low: CVSS 0.1-3.9 or minimal business impact

### Prioritization Criteria

- **Remediation Timeframes**:
  - Critical: 24-48 hours
  - High: 7 days
  - Medium: 30 days
