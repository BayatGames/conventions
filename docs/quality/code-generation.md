## Introduction to Code Generation

### Purpose and Benefits

- **Accelerated Development**: AI-assisted code generation can speed up routine coding tasks
- **Reduced Boilerplate**: Automating repetitive code patterns
- **Knowledge Augmentation**: Accessing patterns and solutions beyond individual knowledge
- **Learning Tool**: Discovering new approaches and techniques

### Scope of Use

- **Appropriate Use Cases**:
  - Generating routine code (CRUD operations, standard patterns)
  - Creating test cases
  - Converting between similar formats or languages
  - Documentation generation
  - Boilerplate reduction
  
- **Inappropriate Use Cases**:
  - Security-critical components
  - Complex business logic without review
  - Performance-critical code without optimization
  - Replacing understanding of fundamental concepts

## Supported Tools

### Primary Tools

1. **GitHub Copilot**:
   - Available for VS Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim
   - Business license required for commercial projects
   - Configuration standards:
     - Enable only on approved repositories
     - Configure .copilotignore for sensitive code areas

2. **Amazon CodeWhisperer**:
   - Available for AWS Cloud9, VS Code, and JetBrains IDEs
   - Usage tracking requirements
   - Configuration standards documented in internal tools wiki

3. **Internal Tools**:
   - Custom code generators for project-specific patterns
   - Template-based generation tools
   - Documentation found on internal developer portal

### Configuration Management

- Store tool configurations in version control
- Document settings and configurations in project README files
- Standardize settings across team members
- Review settings as part of security audits

## Usage Guidelines

### General Principles

- **Understand Before Accepting**: Always understand generated code before accepting it
- **Verify Correctness**: Test and verify all generated code
- **Incremental Use**: Generate small, focused sections rather than large blocks
- **Guide with Comments**: Use comments to guide generation in the right direction
- **Review with Skepticism**: Be particularly skeptical of complex logic or security-related code

### Prompting Techniques

- **Be Specific**: Provide clear, detailed requirements in comments
- **Context Matters**: Ensure relevant context is visible to the generation tool
- **Progressive Refinement**: Start with a high-level description and refine
- **Style Guidance**: Include style examples in visible code or comments
- **Function Signatures**: Define input/output types before generating implementation

### Documentation Requirements

- Comment when code is AI-generated but substantially modified
- Include reference links for generated code based on specific sources
- Document assumptions or limitations in generated code
- Follow standard documentation guidelines

## Quality Control

### Code Review Process

- **Additional Scrutiny**: Apply extra scrutiny during review of generated code
- **Generated Code Indicators**: Consider using comments to mark generated sections
- **Specialized Checklists**: Use AI-specific review checklists
- **Understanding Verification**: Reviewers should verify the author understands the generated code

### Testing Requirements

- Higher test coverage requirements for generated code (target 90%+)
- Include edge case tests for generated algorithms
- Verify performance characteristics match requirements
- Test error handling explicitly

### Refactoring Guidelines

- Refactor generated code to follow team conventions
- Break down complex generated functions into smaller, testable units
- Eliminate redundant or unnecessary code
- Apply consistent naming conventions

## Security Considerations

### Data Privacy

- Never share sensitive or proprietary code as context for generation
- Be aware of context window limitations and what might be inadvertently included
- Disable telemetry when working with sensitive codebases
- Use private instances for highly confidential projects

### Common Vulnerabilities

- **Special Review Areas**:
  - Authentication and authorization code
  - Input validation and sanitization
  - SQL or database query generation
  - File system operations
  - Network request handling
  - Encryption and key management
  
- **Mitigation Strategies**:
  - Run static analysis tools on generated code
  - Perform security-focused code reviews
  - Apply standard security testing procedures

### Dependency Management

- Verify licenses of suggested dependencies
- Check security vulnerabilities in suggested packages
- Follow [Dependency Management Standards](docs/dependencies/management.md) standards
- Prefer suggesting established, well-maintained libraries

## Training and Onboarding

### Developer Training

- Required training modules for AI code generation tools
- Understanding limitations and best practices
- Security awareness for code generation
- How to effectively prompt for better results

### Team Knowledge Sharing

- Share effective prompts and patterns
- Document project-specific generation techniques
- Regular review of generation effectiveness
- Collect examples of successful and problematic generations

## Ethical and Legal Considerations

### Intellectual Property

- Understand the training data sources for your tools
- Be aware of license implications for generated code
- Document generation usage for compliance purposes
- Follow company policies on attribution and licensing

### Code Attribution

- When to attribute generated code:
  - Direct use of generated code from documented sources
  - Generated solutions to standard algorithms
  - Generated implementations of patented techniques
- When attribution is not needed:
  - Standard language syntax and patterns
  - Common, non-unique implementations

### Bias and Fairness

- Be aware of potential biases in generated code
- Review for inclusive language and approaches
- Challenge generated assumptions and defaults
- Report problematic generations to tool providers

## Measuring Effectiveness

### Productivity Metrics

- Time saved vs. manual implementation
- Reduction in boilerplate code
- Decrease in time spent on routine tasks
- Impact on overall delivery timelines

### Quality Metrics

- Bug rates in generated vs. manual code
- Technical debt introduced
- Maintainability index comparisons
- Security issue discovery rate

### Adoption Measurement

- Tool usage across teams
- Developer satisfaction surveys
- Improvement in adoption over time
- Training effectiveness

### Trend Analysis

- Measuring quality impact
- Trend analysis

## Best Practices by Language

### JavaScript/TypeScript

- Guide type generation with explicit type definitions
- Use JSDoc comments to improve generation quality
- Be explicit about framework being used (React, Angular, etc.)
- Include imports to guide library usage
- Examples:

  ```typescript
  // Generate a React component that displays a sortable table of users
  // with columns for name, email, and role. Include pagination.
  // The component should handle loading and error states.
  type User = {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    email: string;
    role: 'admin' | 'user' | 'guest';
  };
  ```

### Python

- Use type hints to guide generation
- Include docstrings for function signatures
- Be explicit about framework context (Django, Flask, etc.)
- Reference style guide (PEP 8) in comments
- Examples:

  ```python
  # Generate a function that processes a CSV file,
  # extracts specific columns, and returns a pandas DataFrame
  # with proper error handling for missing files or malformed data
  def process_csv_file(file_path: str, columns: List[str]) -> pd.DataFrame:
      """
      Process a CSV file and return specified columns as a DataFrame.
      
      Args:
          file_path: Path to the CSV file
          columns: List of column names to extract
          
      Returns:
          DataFrame containing the specified columns
          
      Raises:
          FileNotFoundError: If the file doesn't exist
          ValueError: If the CSV is malformed or specified columns don't exist
      """
  ```

### Java

- Include package and import statements
- Use interface definitions to guide implementations
- Be explicit about framework being used (Spring, etc.)
- Reference standard patterns in comments
- Examples:

  ```java
  // Generate a Spring Data JPA repository interface
  // for a User entity with custom methods to find users
  // by email and role with pagination support
  package com.bayat.user.repository;
  
  import com.bayat.user.model.User;
  import org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.JpaRepository;
  
  public interface UserRepository extends JpaRepository<User, Long> {
      // Custom methods will be generated here
  }
  ```
