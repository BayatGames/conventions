# Code Review Standards

This document outlines Bayat's standards and best practices for conducting code reviews. Code reviews are a critical part of our development process to ensure code quality, knowledge sharing, and continuous improvement.

## Core Principles

Our code review process is guided by these core principles:

1. **Quality Assurance**: Identify bugs, vulnerabilities, and edge cases early.
2. **Knowledge Sharing**: Spread knowledge and best practices across the team.
3. **Consistency**: Ensure adherence to coding standards and architectural patterns.
4. **Mentorship**: Provide opportunities for more experienced developers to mentor others.
5. **Continuous Improvement**: Refine code and processes through constructive feedback.

## Code Review Process

### Before Submitting Code for Review

1. **Self-Review**: Review your own code first:
   - Run automated checks (linters, tests, etc.)
   - Check for adherence to coding standards
   - Ensure adequate test coverage
   - Verify the code works as expected

2. **PR Preparation**:
   - Create a focused, appropriately sized PR
   - Write a clear PR description explaining what, why, and how
   - Reference related issues or tickets
   - Include testing instructions
   - Add screenshots for UI changes
   - Highlight any areas of concern for reviewers

### During Review

1. **Reviewer Selection**:
   - At least one reviewer should be a domain expert
   - Include a mix of senior and junior developers when possible
   - Consider including someone unfamiliar with the code for fresh perspective

2. **Review Time Expectations**:
   - Reviews should be completed within 24 business hours
   - For urgent PRs, notify reviewers via appropriate channels
   - Block time in your schedule for code reviews

3. **Review Process**:
   - Reviewers should first understand the purpose and approach
   - Use the review checklist (see below)
   - Distinguish between required changes and suggestions
   - Provide constructive, actionable feedback

4. **Author Response**:
   - Respond to all comments
   - Address required changes
   - Consider suggestions and provide rationale if not implementing
   - Request re-review once changes are made

### After Review

1. **Merge Process**:
   - PR can be merged once all required changes are addressed
   - Final approval by at least one reviewer is required
   - For complex changes, re-validation may be necessary

2. **Follow-up**:
   - Track review comments for recurring issues
   - Consider improvements to standards or templates
   - Share learnings with the broader team if applicable

## Review Checklist

### General

- [ ] **Purpose**: Does the code accomplish its intended purpose?
- [ ] **Complexity**: Is the code as simple as possible for the required functionality?
- [ ] **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Is there any duplicate code that should be refactored?
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Are errors handled appropriately?
- [ ] **Edge Cases**: Are potential edge cases considered and handled?
- [ ] **Security**: Are there any security concerns (injection vulnerabilities, exposed credentials, etc.)?
- [ ] **Performance**: Are there any obvious performance issues?
- [ ] **Accessibility**: Does the code meet accessibility requirements (for UI components)?
- [ ] **Internationalization**: Is the code prepared for internationalization if required?

### Code Quality

- [ ] **Naming**: Are variables, methods, and classes named clearly and consistently?
- [ ] **Comments**: Are complex sections adequately commented? Are outdated comments removed?
- [ ] **Code Style**: Does the code follow our style guidelines?
- [ ] **Readability**: Is the code easily understandable to other developers?
- [ ] **Documentation**: Is appropriate documentation included or updated?
- [ ] **API Design**: Are public interfaces well-designed and documented?

### Testing

- [ ] **Test Coverage**: Are there sufficient tests for the changes?
- [ ] **Test Quality**: Do tests validate the correct behavior rather than just the implementation?
- [ ] **Edge Cases**: Do tests cover edge cases and error scenarios?
- [ ] **Performance Tests**: For performance-critical code, are there benchmarks?

### Architecture and Design

- [ ] **Architecture Alignment**: Does the code align with the project's architecture?
- [ ] **Dependencies**: Are dependencies appropriate and minimized?
- [ ] **Extensibility**: Is the code designed to be extended if requirements change?
- [ ] **Patterns**: Are appropriate design patterns used consistently?

### Project-Specific Checks

- [ ] **Game Development**: Are Unity/Unreal-specific best practices followed?
- [ ] **Web Development**: Are frontend/backend separation concerns addressed?
- [ ] **Mobile Development**: Are mobile-specific considerations (battery, memory, etc.) addressed?
- [ ] **Library Development**: Is the public API well-designed and documented?

## Code Review Etiquette

### For Authors

1. **Be Open to Feedback**: Approach reviews as an opportunity to learn, not as criticism.
2. **Explain Context**: Provide background and context to help reviewers understand your choices.
3. **Respond to All Comments**: Address each comment, even if just to acknowledge it.
4. **Don't Take Feedback Personally**: The review is about the code, not about you.
5. **Break Down Large Changes**: Keep PRs focused and manageable (under 400 lines when possible).

### For Reviewers

1. **Be Respectful and Constructive**: Focus on the code, not the person.
2. **Explain Reasoning**: Explain why something should be changed, not just that it should.
3. **Prioritize Feedback**: Distinguish between critical issues and nice-to-haves.
4. **Ask, Don't Tell**: Phrase feedback as questions when appropriate ("Have you considered...?").
5. **Acknowledge Good Work**: Point out exemplary code, not just issues.
6. **Be Specific**: Provide concrete suggestions rather than vague criticism.
7. **Review Thoroughly**: Superficial reviews provide little value; take the time to understand the code.

### Example Feedback Phrasing

| Instead of | Consider |
|------------|----------|
| "This is wrong." | "This might cause an issue when X happens. Consider handling it this way..." |
| "Why did you do it this way?" | "I'm curious about the approach here. What was the reasoning behind this implementation?" |
| "Use X pattern here." | "This seems like a good candidate for the X pattern because it would provide these benefits..." |
| "This code is messy." | "This section could be more readable if we extracted this logic into a separate method." |

## Project-Specific Considerations

### Game Development

- Review scene and prefab changes carefully
- Consider performance impacts, especially for runtime code
- Check for frame-dependent logic issues
- Validate component dependencies and nullability handling

### Web Development

- Review browser compatibility considerations
- Check API contracts and error handling
- Validate security practices (CSRF protection, XSS prevention, etc.)
- Consider UX and accessibility guidelines

### Mobile Development

- Check for platform-specific handling
- Review performance and battery usage implications
- Validate responsive layouts and device compatibility
- Consider offline functionality where appropriate

### Library Development

- Review public API design carefully
- Check for backward compatibility
- Validate documentation completeness
- Consider extensibility and customization points

## Automation and Tools

### Automated Checks

Configure automated checks to run before manual review:

- **Linting**: StyleCop, ESLint, etc.
- **Static Analysis**: SonarQube, ReSharper, etc.
- **Test Coverage**: Ensure minimum coverage requirements are met
- **Build Verification**: Confirm the code builds successfully
- **Performance Benchmarks**: For performance-critical changes

### Code Review Tools

Effective use of code review tools:

- **Pull Request Templates**: Use our standard templates for consistency
- **Inline Comments**: Reference specific lines of code
- **Review Status**: Use appropriate review states (approve, request changes, comment)
- **Suggested Changes**: Use suggestion feature for simple fixes
- **Review Filters**: Focus on specific files or changes when dealing with large PRs

## Metrics and Continuous Improvement

### Review Metrics

We track these metrics to improve our review process:

- Time to first review
- Time to merge after submission
- Number of review iterations
- Types of issues found in review
- Test coverage changes

### Process Improvement

The code review process itself should be regularly reviewed:

1. **Retrospectives**: Discuss code review experiences in team retrospectives
2. **Standards Evolution**: Update standards based on recurring feedback
3. **Training**: Provide guidance for new team members on effective reviews
4. **Knowledge Sharing**: Share code review learnings across teams
