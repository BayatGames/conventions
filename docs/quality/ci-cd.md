## Introduction

This document outlines the standard conventions and best practices for Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) at Bayat. These guidelines aim to ensure consistent, reliable, and efficient build, test, and deployment processes across all projects.

## CI/CD Principles

### Core Principles

- Automate everything that can be automated
- Build once, deploy many times
- Test early and often
- Fail fast and fix immediately
- Keep the main branch always deployable
- Treat infrastructure as code
- Make the process visible to everyone
- Continuously improve the pipeline

### CI/CD Benefits

- Faster feedback on changes
- Reduced integration problems
- Improved code quality
- Increased deployment frequency
- Reduced time to market
- More reliable releases
- Better collaboration between teams
- Improved developer productivity

## Pipeline Structure

### Standard Pipeline Stages

1. **Trigger**: Event that initiates the pipeline
2. **Build**: Compile code and create artifacts
3. **Test**: Run automated tests
4. **Analysis**: Perform code quality and security checks
5. **Artifact Storage**: Store build artifacts
6. **Deployment**: Deploy to target environments
7. **Verification**: Verify deployment success
8. **Notification**: Notify stakeholders of results

### Pipeline Visualization

                                                                 │

```

### Pipeline Types

- **CI Pipeline**: Build, test, and analyze code changes
- **CD Pipeline**: Deploy to staging and production environments
- **Feature Pipeline**: Build and test feature branches
- **Release Pipeline**: Prepare and deploy releases
- **Hotfix Pipeline**: Expedited pipeline for critical fixes

## Version Control Integration

### Branch Strategy

- Follow the \1\2)
- Implement branch protection rules
- Require code reviews before merging
- Enforce status checks to pass before merging
- Automatically build and test pull requests

### Commit Triggers

- Trigger CI on commits to main/master branch
- Trigger CI on pull request creation and updates
- Trigger CI on tag creation for releases
- Consider scheduled builds for long-term stability
- Implement skip directives for minor changes

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions trigger configuration
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 2 * * 1'  # Run at 2 AM every Monday
```

## Build Process

### Build Environment

- Use consistent, reproducible build environments
- Containerize build environments when possible
- Document all build dependencies
- Pin dependency versions for stability
- Implement proper caching for faster builds

### Build Steps

- Clean the workspace before building
- Restore dependencies
- Compile code
- Create deployable artifacts
- Version artifacts consistently
- Archive build outputs
- Document build parameters

```yaml
# Example build steps in GitHub Actions
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '16'
          cache: 'npm'
      
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
      
      - name: Build
        run: npm run build
      
      - name: Archive artifacts
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: build-artifacts
          path: dist/
```

### Build Performance

- Optimize build scripts for speed
- Implement parallel builds when possible
- Use incremental builds when appropriate
- Cache dependencies and intermediate outputs
- Monitor and optimize build times

## Testing Strategy

### Test Types

1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual components
2. **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions
3. **Functional Tests**: Test complete features
4. **End-to-End Tests**: Test entire application flows
5. **Performance Tests**: Test system performance
6. **Security Tests**: Test for vulnerabilities

### Test Execution

- Run fast tests early in the pipeline
- Run slower tests later in the pipeline
- Parallelize tests when possible
- Implement proper test timeouts
- Retry flaky tests with backoff strategy

```yaml

  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      - name: Set up Node.js

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
      
      - name: Run unit tests
        run: npm run test:unit
      
      - name: Run integration tests
        run: npm run test:integration
      
      - name: Upload test results
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
