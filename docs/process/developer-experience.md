# Developer Experience (DX) Guidelines

## Introduction

Developer Experience (DX) refers to the overall experience developers have when working with tools, platforms, APIs, and environments. A good developer experience increases productivity, reduces frustration, and leads to higher quality code.

## Principles

1. **Simplicity First**: Tools and processes should be as simple as possible to accomplish their purpose
2. **Minimize Friction**: Reduce barriers to productive work
3. **Fast Feedback Loops**: Developers should receive rapid feedback on their work
4. **Self-Service**: Empower developers to solve problems without waiting for others
5. **Automation**: Automate repetitive tasks whenever possible

## Workstation Setup

### Standard Development Environment

- Maintain up-to-date setup scripts for all major operating systems
- Document environment requirements clearly
- Use containerized development environments when appropriate
- Provide virtual machines for specialized development needs

### IDE Configuration

- Maintain standard configurations for popular IDEs
- Share useful extensions and plugins
- Provide project-specific editor configs and settings
- Standardize formatter and linter configurations

## CLI Tools

### Command Line Experience

- Create consistent, intuitive command line interfaces
- Implement thorough help documentation for all CLI tools
- Ensure detailed, actionable error messages
- Implement progress indicators for long-running processes

### Custom Scripts and Tools

- Document all custom scripts and tools thoroughly
- Include examples and use cases in script documentation
- Maintain versioning for internal tools
- Implement graceful error handling and logging

## Local Development

### Local Setup

- Provide one-command setup for local development environments
- Ensure parity between local and production environments
- Document any necessary manual configuration steps clearly
- Implement health checks for local development environments

### Hot Reloading

- Implement hot reloading for all applicable technologies
- Minimize rebuild/restart times
- Maintain watch modes for all development servers
- Optimize compilation and bundling for development speed

## Documentation

### Code-Proximate Documentation

- Place documentation as close to the code as possible
- Maintain up-to-date READMEs for all projects and significant components
- Document API endpoints with examples
- Include diagrams for complex systems or workflows

### Searchable Knowledge Base

- Maintain a central, searchable repository of knowledge
- Tag and categorize documentation for easy discoverability
- Include troubleshooting guides for common issues
- Document frequently asked questions and their answers

## Testing Experience

### Test Environment

- Provide streamlined setup for test environments
- Ensure tests can be run with a single command
- Support running subsets of tests for faster feedback
- Implement visual testing tools where applicable

### Test Output

- Ensure clear, actionable test failure messages
- Provide visual differentiation between types of test failures
- Include context and debugging information in test output
- Support test reporting in multiple formats

## Feedback Systems

### Error Reporting

- Implement comprehensive error tracking
- Ensure developers receive notifications of errors in their code
- Provide context and stack traces for all errors
- Link errors to relevant documentation

### Performance Monitoring

- Make performance metrics accessible to developers
- Implement performance budgets with automated checking
- Notify developers of performance regressions
- Provide tools for performance profiling in development

## Continuous Integration

### Build Feedback

- Ensure fast CI builds for rapid feedback
- Implement detailed build logs
- Notify developers of build failures immediately
- Prioritize test stability in CI environments

### Pull Request Experience

- Implement automated code review tools
- Provide comprehensive PR templates
- Automate as many checks as possible
- Ensure clear documentation of PR process

## API Experience

### API Design

- Create consistent, intuitive API interfaces
- Provide comprehensive API documentation with examples
- Implement clear error messages and status codes
- Support versioning and backwards compatibility

### API Testing Tools

- Provide tools for testing APIs locally
- Maintain up-to-date Postman collections or similar
- Support mocking of external APIs for development
- Implement API health checks and monitoring

## Measurement and Improvement

### DX Metrics

- Track time spent on environment setup
- Measure build and test times
- Survey developers regularly about pain points
- Monitor usage of development tools and resources

### Continuous Improvement

- Dedicate time to addressing developer experience issues
- Maintain a backlog of DX improvements
- Regularly review and update development tools
- Create a feedback channel for DX issues
