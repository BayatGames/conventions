# Innovation Framework

## Introduction

This document outlines a structured approach to innovation within Bayat projects. It provides guidelines for exploring, evaluating, and integrating new technologies while balancing innovation with stability, reliability, and technical excellence.

## Innovation Principles

### Core Principles

- **Balance stability and innovation**: Implement innovation in a controlled manner that doesn't jeopardize stability
