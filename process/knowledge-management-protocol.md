# Knowledge Management Protocol

This document establishes standardized protocols for knowledge management across Bayat projects, focusing on documentation maintenance, institutional knowledge sharing, and preventing knowledge silos.

## Purpose

Effective knowledge management ensures critical information is documented, accessible, and maintained. This protocol aims to:

1. **Preserve Institutional Knowledge**: Capture, structure, and retain organizational expertise
2. **Prevent Knowledge Silos**: Ensure information is accessible across teams
3. **Standardize Knowledge Processes**: Define consistent methods for knowledge capture and sharing
4. **Facilitate Knowledge Transfer**: Enable smooth transition of knowledge between team members
5. **Support Decision Making**: Provide accurate and up-to-date information for decisions

## Knowledge Types and Classification

### Knowledge Classification

Classify knowledge by type:

1. **Procedural Knowledge**: Step-by-step instructions for completing tasks
2. **Conceptual Knowledge**: Principles, models, and frameworks
3. **Technical Knowledge**: System-specific technical details
4. **Business Knowledge**: Domain expertise and business rules
5. **Cultural Knowledge**: Organizational values, history, and context

### Knowledge Lifecycle States

Define knowledge lifecycle states:

1. **Draft**: Initial capture, potentially incomplete
2. **Reviewed**: Verified by subject matter experts
3. **Published**: Officially available for reference
4. **Maintained**: Regularly updated and verified
5. **Archived**: Historical but no longer actively used
