## Introduction

Onboarding journey maps provide a structured path for new team members to become productive contributors. They combine technical setup, knowledge transfer, and cultural integration into a cohesive experience.

### Goals of Onboarding Journey Maps

1. **Reduce Time to Productivity**: Accelerate the path to meaningful contributions
2. **Ensure Consistency**: Provide a standardized experience across teams
3. **Build Confidence**: Create a supportive environment for learning
4. **Transfer Knowledge**: Share critical information systematically
5. **Reinforce Culture**: Integrate new team members into company values and practices

### Benefits

- Reduces onboarding anxiety for new team members
- Creates accountability for both the new hire and the team
- Provides clear expectations and milestones
- Enables measurement and improvement of the onboarding process

## Journey Map Structure

Each onboarding journey map should follow a consistent structure:

### Core Components

1. **Timeline**: Clear phases with time-based milestones (day 1, week 1, month 1)
2. **Tasks**: Specific activities to complete at each stage
3. **Resources**: Links to tools, documentation, and people
4. **Expected Outcomes**: Clearly defined goals for each phase
5. **Checkpoints**: Scheduled reviews to assess progress

### Visualization Standards

Onboarding journey maps should be visualized as:

1. **Linear Timeline**: Showing progression through phases
2. **Kanban Board**: Tasks organized by status and phase
3. **Interactive Document**: Checklist with embedded resources

Example timeline format:

```plaintext
Pre-boarding → Day 1 → Days 2-5 → Week 2 → Weeks 3-4 → Month 2 → Month 3
```

## Onboarding Phases

### Phase Definition Standards

Each onboarding phase should be clearly defined with:

1. **Phase Name**: Clear, descriptive title
2. **Duration**: Expected time commitment
3. **Primary Goals**: 2-3 key outcomes
4. **Key Activities**: Prioritized list of tasks
5. **Success Criteria**: How completion is measured

Example phase definition:

```markdown
## Technical Environment Setup (Days 1-2)

**Duration**: 2 days

**Primary Goals**:
- Complete development environment setup
- Access all required systems and tools
- Run and test local development workflow

**Key Activities**:
1. Install required development tools
2. Set up project repositories
3. Configure local development environment
4. Complete first build process
