# Unity Development Conventions - MDC Files

These Multi-Document Context (MDC) files provide quick reference guidelines for Unity game development according to Bayat standards. Place these files in the `.cursor/mdc/` directory of your project to enable context-aware development in Cursor IDE.

## Available Convention Files

- [C# Coding Standards](csharp_standards.md) - C# naming conventions, structure, and best practices for Unity
- [Unity Scripting](unity_scripting.md) - Unity-specific scripting patterns and optimization techniques
- [Asset Management](asset_management.md) - Project organization, asset handling, and folder structure
- [Performance Guidelines](performance_guidelines.md) - Performance optimization tips for Unity development

## Setup Instructions

1. Create a `.cursor/mdc/` directory in your project root
2. Copy these MDC files into that directory
3. Add the corresponding `.cursorrules` file from `templates/cursorrules/unity.json` to your project root as `.cursorrules`
