# React/TypeScript Conventions - MDC Files

These Multi-Document Context (MDC) files provide quick reference guidelines for React and TypeScript development according to Bayat standards. Place these files in the `.cursor/mdc/` directory of your project to enable context-aware development in Cursor IDE.

## Available Convention Files

- [TypeScript Conventions](typescript.md) - TypeScript naming conventions, type definitions, and best practices
- [React Development](react.md) - React component patterns, hooks usage, and performance optimizations
- [Component Structure](component_structure.md) - Directory organization, file structure, and component composition

## Setup Instructions

1. Create a `.cursor/mdc/` directory in your project root
2. Copy these MDC files into that directory
3. Add the corresponding `.cursorrules` file from `templates/cursorrules/react-typescript.json` to your project root as `.cursorrules`
