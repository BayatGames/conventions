# Full-Stack Project Conventions - MDC Files

These Multi-Document Context (MDC) files provide quick reference guidelines for full-stack development according to Bayat standards. Place these files in the `.cursor/mdc/` directory of your project to enable context-aware development in Cursor IDE.

## Available Convention Files

- [Project Structure](project_structure.md) - Full-stack project organization, frontend and backend structure

## Additional Files

For a complete full-stack setup, you should also incorporate the following MDC files:

- Frontend files from [React/TypeScript Conventions](../react-typescript/)
- Backend files from [Node.js Backend Conventions](../nodejs-backend/)

## Setup Instructions

1. Create a `.cursor/mdc/` directory in your project root
2. Copy these MDC files into that directory
3. Add the corresponding `.cursorrules` file from `templates/cursorrules/fullstack.json` to your project root as `.cursorrules`
