## Introduction to Performance Budgets

### Definition and Purpose

Performance budgets are quantifiable limits set on performance metrics that teams must not exceed. They serve to:

- Establish clear performance expectations
- Provide objective measures for performance quality
- Help catch performance regressions before release
- Ensure consistent user experience across devices
- Align teams on performance priorities

### Types of Performance Metrics

1. **Quantity-based metrics**:
   - File size (total, per file type, per module)
   - Number of HTTP requests
   - Number of DOM elements

2. **Timing-based metrics**:
   - Load time (Time to Interactive, First Contentful Paint, etc.)
   - Response time
   - Animation frames per second
   - Time to first API response

3. **Rule-based metrics**:
   - Lighthouse scores
   - PageSpeed Insights
   - Custom heuristic evaluations

4. **User-centric metrics**:
   - Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS)
   - Custom user experience measurements

### Implementation Approach

- Define budgets early in the development lifecycle
- Integrate into CI/CD pipelines
- Make budgets visible in dashboards
- Set alerts for approaching limits
- Schedule regular review of budget effectiveness
